# Project Context
Ultracite enforces strict type safety, accessibility standards, and consistent code quality for JavaScript/TypeScript projects using Biome's lightning-fast formatter and linter.

## Key Principles
- Zero configuration required
- Subsecond performance
- Maximum type safety
- AI-friendly code generation

## Before Writing Code
1. Analyze existing patterns in the codebase
2. Consider edge cases and error scenarios
3. Follow the rules below strictly
4. Validate accessibility requirements

## Rules

### Accessibility (a11y)
- Don't use `accessKey` attribute on any HTML element.
- Don't set `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.
- Don't add ARIA roles, states, and properties to elements that don't support them.
- Don't use distracting elements like `<marquee>` or `<blink>`.
- Only use the `scope` prop on `<th>` elements.
- Don't assign non-interactive ARIA roles to interactive HTML elements.
- Make sure label elements have text content and are associated with an input.
- Don't assign interactive ARIA roles to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't assign `tabIndex` to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't use positive integers for `tabIndex` property.
- Don't include "image", "picture", or "photo" in img alt prop.
- Don't use explicit role property that's the same as the implicit/default role.
- Make static elements with click handlers use a valid role attribute.
- Always include a `title` element for SVG elements.
- Give all elements requiring alt text meaningful information for screen readers.
- Make sure anchors have content that's accessible to screen readers.

- Give heading elements content that's accessible to screen readers (not hidden with `aria-hidden`).
- Always include a `lang` attribute on the html element.
- Always include a `title` attribute for iframe elements.
- Accompany `onClick` with at least one of: `onKeyUp`, `onKeyDown`, or `onKeyPress`.
- Accompany `onMouseOver`/`onMouseOut` with `onFocus`/`onBlur`.
- Include caption tracks for audio and video elements.
- Use semantic elements instead of role attributes in JSX.
- Make sure all anchors are valid and navigable.
- Ensure all ARIA properties (`aria-*`) are valid.
- Use valid, non-abstract ARIA roles for elements with ARIA roles.
- Use valid ARIA state and property values.

### Next.js Specific Rules

### Testing Best Practices
- Don't use export or module.exports in test files.

## Common Tasks
- `npx ultracite init` - Initialize Ultracite in your project
- `npx ultracite fix` - Format and fix code automatically
- `npx ultracite check` - Check for issues without fixing

## Example: Error Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}

// ❌ Bad: Swallowing errors
try {
  return await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```
