![MUI Table](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1612832021455-245704c6755a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHxvbiUyMGxhcHRvcHxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjAxNjg0NTN8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Simple/Basic Table

This is a basic table with fixed column and row numbers. It is simple to implement and provides a straightforward display of tabular data.

### Data Table

The Data Table is used when a large amount of data requires more complex insights. This table type features advanced functionalities like pagination, sorting, and filtering.

### Dense Table

A dense table minimizes table size and spacing between rows. This table type is useful when space is limited and much data needs to be displayed compactly.

### Collapsible Table

The Collapsible Table has expandable rows that reveal more information when clicked. This table type utilizes the Collapse component to provide additional details about each row.

### Spanning Table

A spanning Table allows for the combination of multiple rows or columns. A good example of a Spanning Table might be a billing table where information from various sections is combined for easier viewing.

### Virtualized Table

In a Virtualized Table, a large amount of data is handled within a single frame to save resources. This eliminates the need for pagination or a traditional data table, making it more efficient for managing extensive datasets.

## Creating A Basic MUI Table

![MUI Table](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516321497487-e288fb19713f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHx3aXRoJTIwdGVhbXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjAxNjg0Nzh8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Tables are essential for creating appealing and functional user interfaces. Material-UI provides a comprehensive set of components for creating tables. These tables are not just visually appealing; they are also highly customizable and functional. Let's delve into how to create these MUI tables with an example.

### Basic Table

A simple example with no frills. Here's how you can create a basic table component using Material-UI:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import Table from "@mui/material/Table";
import TableBody from "@mui/material/TableBody";
import TableCell from "@mui/material/TableCell";
import TableContainer from "@mui/material/TableContainer";
import TableHead from "@mui/material/TableHead";
import TableRow from "@mui/material/TableRow";
import Paper from "@mui/material/Paper";

function createData(
  name: string,
  calories: number,
  fat: number,
  carbs: number,
  protein: number
) {
  return { name, calories, fat, carbs, protein };
}

const rows = [
  createData("Frozen yoghurt", 159, 6.0, 24, 4.0),
  createData("Ice cream sandwich", 237, 9.0, 37, 4.3),
  createData("Eclair", 262, 16.0, 24, 6.0),
  createData("Cupcake", 305, 3.7, 67, 4.3),
  createData("Gingerbread", 356, 16.0, 49, 3.9),
];

export default function BasicTable() {
  return (
    <TableContainer component={Paper}>
      <Table sx={{ minWidth: 650 }} aria-label="simple table">
        <TableHead>
          <TableRow>
            <TableCell>Dessert (100g serving)</TableCell>
            <TableCell align="right">Calories</TableCell>
            <TableCell align="right">Fat&nbsp;(g)</TableCell>
            <TableCell align="right">Carbs&nbsp;(g)</TableCell>
            <TableCell align="right">Protein&nbsp;(g)</TableCell>
          </TableRow>
        </TableHead>
        <TableBody>
          {rows.map((row) => (
            <TableRow
              key={row.name}
              sx={{ "&:last-child td, &:last-child th": { border: 0 } }}
            >
              <TableCell component="th" scope="row">
                {row.name}
              </TableCell>
              <TableCell align="right">{row.calories}</TableCell>
              <TableCell align="right">{row.fat}</TableCell>
              <TableCell align="right">{row.carbs}</TableCell>
              <TableCell align="right">{row.protein}</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
          ))}
        </TableBody>
      </Table>
    </TableContainer>
  );
}
```

This code creates a simple table with 5 columns for:

- Dessert (100g serving)
- Calories
- Fat (g)
- Carbs (g)
- Protein (g)

You can customize the simple table's column header and column values or other data and appearance according to your project's needs.

After creating the Basic Table, you can import it into your base file (e.g., App.js) and use it within your application. Following these steps, you can efficiently create and customize tables using Material-UI's components.

## Different Props To Be Used In React Tables

![MUI Table](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510915228340-29c85a43dcfe?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxjb2RlcnxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjAxNjg0ODl8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Sorting and Selecting

Sorting and selecting are essential props when dealing with React tables. Sorting helps arrange rows in ascending or descending order based on the column type. This allows users to navigate the data easily and find what they need efficiently.

On the other hand, selection lets users select multiple data rows to delete or perform other actions based on their needs. This enhances the table's interactivity and functionality, providing a more seamless user experience.

### Pagination

The pagination feature allows users to effectively manage the data displayed in a React table. The ActionsComponent prop of the TablePagination component empowers the implementation of custom actions.

Users can configure the number of data rows displayed per page and switch between pages to explore the data at their own pace. This breaks down large datasets into manageable chunks, making it easier for users to consume the information without feeling overwhelmed or lost in a sea of data.

### Sticky Header

The sticky header prop in MUI tables ensures that the header remains fixed while scrolling through the rows. This feature provides a consistent view of the table's structure, making it easy to reference column names and maintain context as users navigate the data.

By keeping the header visible at all times, users can quickly identify which data column they are viewing and understand the information being presented, enhancing the table's overall usability.

### Column Grouping

Column grouping is a handy feature that allows users to group multiple columns together using the `TableRow` item inside the table header. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets that require subtypes or categories within a single class.

Users can visually organize the data by grouping related columns and more effectively understand the relationships between data points. This feature simplifies data exploration and analysis, helping users derive meaningful insights from the information presented in the table.
