A pricing page is a dedicated landing page on a website that outlines the various pricing options or tiers for a product or service. It details each tier’s cost, features, and benefits, helping potential customers understand what they will receive at different price points.

### Making the Choice Easy

This page often:

- Compares features across tiers
- Has clear call-to-action buttons
- Includes customer testimonials.

It also offers free trials or money-back guarantees to build trust and encourage conversions.

### The Heart of Sales

Your pricing page is the landing page on your website that lists the different pricing options or tiers available to customers and the benefits and features included in each tier. It is the most important page on your website—without a well-designed pricing page, you’ll lose conversions and potential revenue.

## What Makes An Effective Pricing Page? Elements Of A Pricing Page

![Pricing Page Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531403009284-440f080d1e12?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxVSXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjExMTkyODN8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Pricing Table

A well-structured pricing table is crucial for a pricing page to give visitors a concise overview of different plans or tiers. This allows visitors to:

- Compare
- Choose the most suitable option quickly.

#### Understanding Your Options

A pricing table typically includes information such as:

- The features included in each tier
- The pricing for each tier
- Any additional benefits that come with specific options.

Visitors can decide which plan best meets their needs by presenting this information in an easily digestible format.

### Pricing Comparisons

Highlighting the features and benefits of each pricing tier through clear comparisons enables users to differentiate between options and select the one that best aligns with their needs. By clearly outlining the value proposition of each tier, visitors can quickly identify which tier offers the best value for their specific requirements.

This also helps visitors understand the differences between various plans, making it easier to decide and convert into paying customers.

### Pricing Calculator

A dynamic pricing calculator on a pricing page allows visitors to customize their requirements and view the corresponding costs instantly, enhancing:

- Transparency
- Personalization

This feature enables potential customers to input their specific needs, such as the number of users, storage requirements, or additional features, and see how these choices affect the overall cost. By providing this level of customization, businesses can increase the likelihood of conversion by demonstrating the flexibility and affordability of their pricing options.

### FAQ Section for Pricing

Addressing common questions and concerns about pricing in a dedicated FAQ section is essential for the following:

- Creating clarity
- Building trust with potential customers

By proactively answering questions visitors may have about pricing, businesses can dispel potential customers' uncertainties. This helps establish credibility and transparency, key factors in converting visitors into customers.

### Immediate Call-to-Action (CTA)

Including a prominent and persuasive [CTA button](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/call-to-action/) on the pricing page encourages visitors to take action and purchase or subscribe to services without any hassle. A well-crafted CTA can guide visitors through the purchasing process, making it easy for them to sign up or purchase. By strategically placing a CTA button near the pricing information, businesses can capitalize on visitors' interest in the product or service and drive conversions.

### Contact Information

Providing convenient ways for potential customers to contact your business on the same page fosters trust and allows any questions or concerns to be addressed promptly. By displaying contact information, companies can reassure visitors that help is readily available. These include:

- Phone numbers
- Email addresses
- Live chat options

This level of accessibility can instill confidence in potential customers and increase the likelihood of conversion.

### Urgency and FOMO

Creating a sense of urgency and fear of missing out on a pricing page can encourage visitors to take action quickly. Businesses can urge visitors to make a decision promptly to avoid missing out on the opportunity by highlighting the following:

- Limited-time offers
- Special discounts
- Exclusive deals

This tactic can help boost conversions and drive sales by leveraging visitors' desire to take advantage of a good deal.

## How Do You Create A Good Price Page?

![Pricing Page Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573867639040-6dd25fa5f597?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxMHx8bGF5b3V0JTIwd2Vic2l0ZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjExMTkzMDB8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Layout

When [designing a pricing page](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pricing-page-examples), the layout should be user-friendly. The navigation should be easy to get through the page with no issues. Ensuring that all critical components are kept above the fold, including at least one call-to-action, is essential for a seamless flow for your potential customers.

### Information

A recent study has indicated that pricing pages packed with information and action result in more confident users converting. Pages that don’t do this well have buyers who are:

- Intimidated
- Distracted
- Discouraged.

Thus, presenting information in a decent order is crucial for the effectiveness of your pricing page.

### Language

When creating a pricing page, it is crucial to speak to your prospective customers in your brand voice. Depending on your target audience, using simple language and avoiding jargon can lead to better understanding. Using the correct copy and colors is critical, ensuring you highlight your features' benefits while avoiding too sales-y language.

### Pricing

Your [pricing page](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/price-testing?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pricing-page-examples&hubs_content-cta=A/B%20test%20your%20pricing) should indicate the pricing options and package offerings. If you offer different packages catering to various sizes and budgets, each option should speak directly to that buyer persona. Highlighting a recommended package plan can alleviate confusion and guide you to where the most value lies.

### CTA and Testing

Your call-to-action (CTA) is a crucial element on your pricing page. It should stand out and have a clear directive for your customer. Use a distinct color for the CTA button and ensure it starts with a verb, telling the reader what they will receive when they take action. Always test your CTAs and other elements on your pricing page to see what's working or not to make data-driven decisions.

## 21 Effective Pricing Page Examples

![Pricing Page Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1486312338219-ce68d2c6f44d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw5fHxvbiUyMHdlYnNpdGUlMjBhbG9uZSUyMGluJTIwb2ZmaWNlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMTExOTMzOXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/pricing) uses the two-tab option for its pricing. One tab is for companies, and the other is for teams. Each has different pricing tiers, making it easy to compare the services. Each tab has a distinctive layout and style, so users won’t be confused and can quickly see the different features offered.

### 2\. BombBomb

BombBomb uses the 3-tab solution, which includes a step-by-step guide for its enterprise plan. At the top, users can choose from:

- Individual
- Teams
- Enterprise solutions

Every tab has a most popular option, and each selection has detailed lists of features so users can choose what best meets their needs. The enterprise plan is completely customizable, so the step-by-step instruction works well.

### 3\. Mailchimp

Mailchimp’s [pricing page](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/marketing/compare-plans/) has three tabs that break down its offerings. In addition to organizing its features, each tab has a relevant tool to help customers better understand what they will pay for and receive. For example, the Marketing Platform tab has an adjustable contact counter that, when moved, changes the prices of each plan to reflect an accurate cost.

### 4\. Zendesk

Zendesk has intuitive card designs for its plans. The first card is inexpensive, but the intro copy highlights “starting at just $5 an agent.” It also shows a free trial option on the first two options. Each card details the payment plans and products to let users know what they are getting in each package so they can make an informed choice.

### 5\. Big Cartel

Big Cartel uses a custom image background for their pricing tiers. The visual aspect of their product is an easy draw for prospective buyers. The text is simple and easy to understand. It’s:

- Attractive
- Informative
- Intuitive

### 6\. HubSpot

The HubSpot [CRM platform](https://www.hubspot.com/pricing/marketing?products=marketing-hub-starter_1&term=annual&hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pricing-page-examples&hubs_content-cta=HubSpot&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pricing-page-examples&hubs_post-cta=HubSpot&_ga=2.18084409.181734736.1720944895-1623441568.1717871070&_gl=1*89hsrj*_gcl_au*NTExMTU2NDY3LjE3MTc4NzEwNzA.*_ga*MTYyMzQ0MTU2OC4xNzE3ODcxMDcw*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTcyMDk0NDg5NS42MS4xLjE3MjA5NDU4NDIuNjAuMC4w) comprises five products:

- Marketing Hub
- Sales Hub
- Service Hub
- Content Hub
- Operations Hub

The pricing page keeps it simple by offering each individually, allowing users to choose the one that best suits their needs. If users are interested in a bundle, they can toggle the tab at the top to get bundle pricing.

### 7\. Box

Box's pricing page is informative, intuitive, and actionable — starting with the heading right at the top, which prompts users to choose the best plan for their business. They did well by allowing users to select their buyer persona by offering two call-to-action buttons at the top:

- Individuals and Teams
- Business Plans

This makes the user experience far simpler. After all, if you're considering buying Box for your business, there's no reason you'd need to see the personal pricing plans (and vice versa).

### 8\. Detectify

Detectify's pricing page design is unusual but creates an excellent user experience. Users can choose between two simple options, depending on their use case. Users can buy a security subscription for:

- Websites they’re hosting
- Applications they’re building

This works well for a single product with a price that only changes depending on what you’re using it for.

### 9\. Wistia

Like any page on your website, design is as important as the information you provide. Wistia's pricing page is one of the most visually pleasing because of its clean, colorful layout and whimsical lines that align with its playful brand.

They also use language that makes it easy for visitors to find a pricing plan that suits their needs. Under each option, they provide a short description of the ideal customer. For example, the Pro version is "For businesses investing in marketing with videos and podcasts.”

### 10\. Casper

This landing page successfully balances concise informational content and the strategic use of space, fostering a clear and user-friendly experience.  Particularly noteworthy is the well-articulated refund policy, which outlines the:

- Free shipping offer
- 100-night trial period
- Full refund guarantee following a 30-night adjustment period

This transparency in return policies, fosters trust and reduces purchase hesitancy among potential customers.

#### Building Trust Before Purchase

The company's willingness to go to a dissatisfied customer's house, pick up the mattress for free, and give a full refund is an excellent testimonial to its dedication to customer service. This builds trust with prospects before they even buy and will help create advocates.

### 11\. Squarespace

Like Zendesk, Squarespace employs strong header copy: "Set up your site, pick a plan later." This reassures users that they don’t have to pay to try the platform; visitors can immediately try it by clicking the “Get Started” button.

We also love that they include frequently asked questions on the same page as the pricing matrix. That way, users can get many questions answered without digging for answers.

### 12\. Ticketleap

When you arrive at their pricing page, you first see "Simple, Straightforward Pricing." This phrasing aims to make users feel like Tickleap is on their side—they won’t get secretly charged once they sign up on the platform.

Later down the page, users can calculate how much they would pay for Ticketleap and get the simple pricing they were promised at the top

### 13\. Pagevamp

Trust elements are great additions to any pricing page. Pagevamp took the cue and placed their trial policy right at the beginning of the page, which says, Every plan starts with a 14-day free trial. While no one wants their customers to churn, you increase the value of your product by providing a free trial.

If you force customers to sign a yearly contract without a trial, that’s a poor policy that might generate short-term revenue but create unhappy customers and poor word-of-mouth down the line.

### 14\. Acquia

The simpler your business' pricing page, the better user experience you'll offer, but this gets harder as your product and pricing model become more complex. Acquia is one such company, but they do a great job in this example. You don’t see the product’s pricing when you land on the page. Instead, you get information on choosing the right self-service option for you.

You also have the option to contact Acquia directly and get an agent to help you pick the right product. This is important if you offer a complex product that might stump professionals who don’t specialize in your field.

### 15\. Asana

Asana has a neat pricing page, with their three pricing plans in a tier table format. Instead of having a toggle for annual versus monthly payments, they have a toggle for:

- Individuals
- Small teams
- Businesses
- Large corporations

#### Features at a Glance

It’s clear how each plan differs in terms of basic features, and you can expand to compare in more detail. They have also included trust badges from major partner organizations and details on discounts for nonprofits.

They have their FAQs at the very end of the page. The page's minimalistic design helps the prospect focus and find the necessary information.

### 16\. Keap

Keap has managed to fit a lot into their pricing page without appearing overcomplicated or cluttered. They have three color-coded pricing plans, a toggle switch for the payment frequency, and an input box for the number of contacts you need.

They’ve listed core features for each pricing plan, but you can also see an expanded view of everything included. They offer onboarding assistance with paid plans and have some information about that and the other additional support they provide. There are also customer testimonials and the usual FAQs.

### 17\. [Smile.io](http://Smile.io)

[Smile.io](http://Smile.io) has different pricing options depending on the e-commerce platform used, be it:

- Shopify
- BigCommerce
- Wix

To make all the information more accessible to process, they list the features in a comparison table with limited text and a tick if the feature is available. An expanded feature comparison is just a click away for those seeking more information.

#### Streamlined Navigation

There are also social trust badges and the all-important FAQs section. Rather than fill the page with more information, they’ve included:

- Some small sections
- A CTA button for details about the free plan
- Alternative options for large corporations

### 18\. Zoom

Zoom’s pricing and plan options are slightly more complicated than others, but they’ve displayed everything well. For example, each pricing category, like Zoom One, Zoom Phone, Zoom Rooms, and so on, comprises different [pricing packages](https://zoom.us/pricing) that are well organized on the page.

These include:

- Basic
- Pro
- Business

#### Choosing Your Plan

Prospects can toggle between annual and monthly payment options and see how the free plan compares to the paid options. The site also provides an overview of the variety of add-ons available and a CTA button to learn about Zoom features.

### 19\. Geckoboard

Geckoboard's colorful pricing page is neatly laid out. The three pricing options are presented in a quick overview tier with drop-down sections for the number of dashboards required. When you scroll further down the page, you can see more details about the features included in each plan.

#### Building Trust with Credibility

Their page also includes social proof with badges from significant companies that:

- Use their product
- Links to customer review websites

There’s an FAQs section categorized by pricing questions or questions about the product itself.

### 20\. ConvertKit

ConvertKit has a beautifully designed pricing page that is visually appealing and user-friendly. This SaaS pricing depends on the number of email subscribers prospects have. To see accurate prices, prospects have to use the slider to select the number of subscribers and can also toggle between monthly or annual payment options.

#### Plan Flexibility

The pricing for the three plans changes depending on your selections. You can:

- View a feature overview
- Expand for more detail.

They have a carousel of famous customers acting as their social proof and an FAQ section.

### 21\. ActiveCampaignActiveCampaign

ActiveCampaign has creatively fit a lot of information into its pricing page without losing coherency. Prospects can easily navigate plan categories by clicking the tabs like:

- Marketing
- Sales
- Email
- Customizable bundles

All plans are customizable, so you can remove or add features as needed and adjust the number of contacts you have. The pricing plans table has minimal details about included features, but you can expand it to get more information.

#### Addressing Your Needs

Towards the bottom of the page, there’s more information about the additional services ActiveCampaign provides and possible integrations. There is also a small FAQ section and contact information for more assistance.

## Pricing Page Design Best Practices

The design layout is crucial when it comes to pricing pages. The information should be organized in a way that is effortless to follow. In particular, the pricing table should be presented in a column format that fits above the fold as much as possible for optimal visibility. This lets visitors quickly:

- Grasp the different pricing options
- Make informed decisions

### Headlines

Strong headlines on a pricing page can significantly impact visitor engagement. They support your value proposition and entice potential customers to explore further. By using clear, concise headlines, you can:

- Communicate the benefits of your product or service
- Capture the attention of your target audience more effectively

### Pricing Tiers

Each pricing tier on your page should cater to a specific market segment and clearly outline its unique value proposition. Listing features highlighting each tier's significant characteristics or benefits helps users understand how the options align with their needs. By clearly defining the value of each tier, you can guide visitors toward the most suitable choice for them.

### Free Options

Providing potential customers with the option to sign up for a free trial or a basic version of your service before making a payment can:

- Reduce their hesitancy
- Increase conversions

By allowing users to experience your offering before committing financially, you can build trust and demonstrate the value of your product or service.

### Toggles/Tabs

Implementing toggles or tabs can help users quickly switch between different features or plans if your pricing model includes more complex options. This feature enhances user experience by allowing visitors to explore various options without feeling overwhelmed by extensive information.

### Tooltips

Tooltips can be valuable additions to a pricing page. They unearth less critical but essential information for users seeking additional context. By providing tooltips, you can offer more detailed information without cluttering the main page, catering to users who want to delve deeper into specific aspects of your offerings.

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons

CTAs play a crucial role in guiding potential customers toward a purchase decision. Whether encouraging users to learn more, contact a sales representative, or make a purchase, well-designed CTAs can drive conversions effectively.

Positioning CTAs strategically and using compelling language can prompt visitors to take action and move them further down the sales funnel.

### FAQ Sections

FAQ sections on pricing pages help [address common questions](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/the-best-faq-page-examples-and-how-to-make-your-own/) potential customers may have about your product or service. You can build trust with visitors and help them make informed decisions by providing detailed answers to frequently asked questions. Anticipating and addressing user queries can improve the overall user experience and increase the likelihood of conversion.

### Trust Signals

Incorporating trust signals on your pricing page can boost credibility and encourage visitors to take action. The following effectively showcase positive customer experiences and establish trust with potential buyers:

- Testimonials
- Customer reviews
- Trust badges

By highlighting social proof and customer satisfaction, you can instill confidence in your offerings and differentiate your brand from competitors.

## Why You Need A Pricing Page On Your Website

![Pricing Page Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518644730709-0835105d9daa?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHx0aGlua2luZyUyMG9uJTIwbGFwdG9wfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMTExOTM1N3ww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Informed Decisions

A well-crafted pricing page on your business website is essential for several reasons. Firstly, transparency is vital for building trust with potential customers. When visitors can easily see what your services or products cost, they feel:

- More informed
- Confident in their decision-making process

Hidden prices can be a red flag, making users wary and potentially driving them away to competitors who are more upfront.

### Qualifying Leads

A detailed pricing page can filter out leads unsuitable for your business. Clear pricing information lets potential customers determine whether your offerings align with their budget. This means they're more likely to be serious prospects when they reach out, saving time for you and them.

### Value Justification

A pricing page can be a powerful sales tool. It allows you to highlight the value of your different packages or services, explaining:

- What each tier includes
- Why certain features justify the price

This can be particularly effective if you use a tiered pricing strategy, where you can showcase additional benefits to upsell customers to higher plans.

### Boosting Visibility

Having a pricing page also improves your site's SEO. When people search for pricing information related to your products or services, a well-optimized pricing page can attract this search traffic, bringing more visitors to your site and increasing the chances of conversion.

In essence, a pricing page is not just about displaying numbers; it's about:

- Communicating value
- Building trust
- Streamlining the sales process

Addressing potential customers' questions upfront can create a smoother purchase path and drive more business.
