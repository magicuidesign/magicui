### Writing Guidelines for Landing Page Copywriting

When writing landing page copy, it's essential to make the text engaging and straightforward without relying on clichés or overused metaphors.

## The Foundational Elements of Compelling Landing Page Copy

![Landing Page Copywriting](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1649252504308-af4a8477cd2a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxpZGVhdGlvbnxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjEzNzIxMDh8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Compelling landing page copy is never static; it evolves to ensure it remains impactful and engaging.

### Delivering a Convincing First Impression

The first step in creating a compelling landing page copy is to provide a convincing first impression of the startup. This involves crafting direct, specific, and grammatically correct copy that sets expectations and raises the bar for future interactions with the company's product and team.

### Considering Market Maturity

The market's maturity plays a significant role in determining the length and complexity of landing page copy. Companies operating in highly mature markets can utilize shorter copy, focusing on product differentiators, brand stories, and user testimonials. In contrast, emerging markets may require more detailed information to educate visitors about the solution and define the category more broadly.

### Reflecting Customer Awareness

Compelling landing page copy should mirror the customer's stage of awareness. This involves understanding how well customers comprehend the challenge the company addresses, the stakes involved, the changing landscape, and tools that can help. Great copy demonstrates the company's awareness of customer awareness levels, creating a connection that resonates with the target audience.

### Uncovering the Problem

First, you need to identify the problem your audience is facing. What issues are holding them back from achieving their goals? Consider what obstacles they may be dealing with and write them down. Identifying the primary problem is crucial to creating compelling landing page copy.

### Understanding Pain Points

After identifying the problem, you need to understand its associated pain points. Dive into what's causing your audience the most distress and what's preventing them from overcoming their obstacles. List these pain points as a reference when writing your landing page copy.

### Providing a Solution

Create a solution that addresses the identified pain points. Consider how your solution can alleviate these distress points and help your audience overcome their challenges. When writing your landing page copy, consider how your offer differentiates from others in the market - this is your unique selling proposition.

### Communicating the Desired Outcome

Your solution should help your audience reach their desired outcome. This outcome should align with their larger vision and goals for their personal life or business. When writing your copy, clearly communicate how your solution can help your audience achieve this desired outcome.

## 12 Landing Page Copywriting Tips for Boosting Conversions

![Landing Page Copywriting](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1650831433364-3bbd0f2d2f01?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHxpZGVhdGlvbnxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjEzNzIxMDh8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Use Customer Testimonials

One of the most powerful conversion copy techniques involves no writing; it involves letting happy customers write your copy for you.

Testimonials produce conversions like nothing else can. It’s impossible to write a copy as good as your customer. Why? A good copy depends on the source, not just the style and substance. Testimonials are compelling because they show the customer what she will experience if she uses your product or service.

### 2\. Emphasize the Benefits, Not the Product/Service

One of the most important lessons I've learned in online marketing is that customers don’t really care about your products or services—in other words, they don't care about the "solution" you're trying to sell them. A group of Harvard researchers conducted a study of 1,400 B2B customers in various fields and concluded that we've reached “the end of solution sales.”

#### The Rise (and Fall) of Solution Selling

Traditionally, sales were predicated on the “solution-selling method.” According to this method, “salespeople are trained to align a solution with an acknowledged customer need and demonstrate why it is better than the competition’s.”

#### Why Traditional Sales Tactics Fail

That approach isn’t working anymore for one straightforward reason: Customers already know the solution they’re looking for. Thanks to the Internet and search engines, they are capable of learning virtually anything. In fact, not only do customers know the solution, but they also know the features they are looking for, the requirements the product must meet, and benchmark pricing.

#### Why Focusing on Customer Value Wins

If you pitch only your solution, you’re not giving your customers what they need and want. You need to pitch benefits. It’s okay to mention your solution because that’s a signal to the customer that he or she is in the right place -- but don’t push that solution. Instead, go for the benefits.

### 3\. Write Attention-Grabbing Headlines

Headlines do the heaviest lifting on any part of your landing page. They’re the first and most visible pieces of copy—the introduction to your offer. A compelling, descriptive headline can distinguish between a visitor thinking, “I need this thing, like, yesterday,” and “how the heck did I end up here?”

Visitors are more likely to bounce when your landing page header isn’t pulling its weight. On the other hand, a strong headline keeps visitors scrolling’ and ensures all the work you’ve put into getting them here doesn’t go to waste.

### 4\. Add Structure with Subheadings

These are headlines for each section of your landing page. They introduce new benefits (or counter specific objections) that tie back your value proposition.

Again, check your info hierarchy. Figure out what crucial information you haven’t included in your header and break it into topic groups. You’ll probably find that most of what you still need to communicate falls into a few categories, like unique product features or secondary benefits. Under a shared subheading, these can become your page sections.

### 5\. Make Your Copy Easy to Scan

People don’t read web pages like they do books. Keep your landing page copy short and create an easily scannable layout so your key points stand out. The Nielsen Norman Group has studied how people read online since 1997. Their findings show consistently that web users scan text instead of reading it.

#### Grab Attention and Drive Conversions

They also noticed some recurring scanning habits, like the F-Pattern. Users start by reading a heading horizontally, then skip to another prominent row of text. You can apply these findings in your landing page copywriting to maximize its impact.

#### Craft Compelling Landing Page Copy

Prioritize key information in headings and subheadings, which users will most likely read. Follow these headings immediately with short, simple sentences that expand on the point and deliver other important information.

#### Craft Scannable Landing Page Copy for Mobile Users

58.3% of internet traffic came from mobile devices in Q1 2023. Keeping your content scannable—i.e., keeping headings short and using white space—makes it easier for mobile users to consume.

### 6\. Write like a Human

Another technique that will help you crush your competition to [sound like a human being](https://theintuitivewritingschool.com/blog/youre-a-human-so-write-like-one). At some point, many copywriters decided producing copy that sounded strained and robotic would be great. Who’s writing this stuff? And who’s reading this stuff? I don’t know, but I do know that no one is converting.

People prefer to connect with other people, not with robots. That’s why your copy needs to sound like a human wrote it. Here are some specific things you can do to make your writing more personal:

#### Write the Way You Speak

Use normal words, like the ones you’d use if you were talking to a ten-year old. For example, why use “convivial” if you can use “friendly?”

#### Use Short Sentences

- Break grammar rules if the writing still sounds good and natural.
- Be funny.

#### Use the First Person

Use expressions you’d use in a normal conversation. “Seriously,” “I’m thinking…,” “Wait a second,” “It was crazy,” “Wow,” “It was pretty awesome,” “It’s like…”

### 7\. Use Numbers and Get Specific

The more specific you are, the more believable and persuasive you will be.

Which one of these claims is more persuasive to you?

- "Your conversion rates will explode!"
- "In the last ninety days, customer conversions have increased by an average of 78.2%."

The second one is far more specific and therefore more believable. Anyone can make blanket claims about awesomeness, but not everyone can cite statistics and detailed metrics.

### 8\. Ask for Readers to Take Action

The final killer technique of a conversion pro is the call to action. You need to ask for conversions to get them. That’s why I suggest you start with the end goal in mind -- and the whole point of your landing page is that conversion. All of your copy should be building up to that conversion.

##### CTA Copywriting for Maximum Impact

Writing CTA button copy is just as important, if not more so, than the rest of the copy on your page. Remember how I mentioned that CTA buttons are one of the copies people read? It matters. Simple changes in wording can create huge conversion increases.

### 9\. Use Visuals to Complement Your Copy

Images and videos can help your landing pages grab attention. They also play a key role in explaining your product to users. A comprehensive study on the effects of video in marketing by [Wyzowl found that 96%](https://www.wyzowl.com/sovm-results-2023/#:~:text=%F0%9F%A7%A0%2096%25%20of%20video%20marketers,of%20their%20product%20or%20service.&text=%F0%9F%93%88%2095%25%20say%20video%20marketing%20has%20helped%20them%20increase%20brand%20awareness.) of marketers think videos improve users' understanding of their product.

The same study also found that 90% of marketers think videos have helped them generate leads, while 87% think videos increased sales and website dwell time. Google data shows images can be just as useful, with results from a consumer survey showing 50% of online shoppers use images to decide what to buy.

##### The Power of Visuals in Landing Page Design

The best landing pages aren’t just text-based. They merge landing page copywriting with visual assets to create a mixed-media experience that suits all users.

As you develop your landing page copy, consider where images or videos can draw attention, demonstrate features, or act as social proof.

### 10\. Maintain Message and Visual Continuity From Ad to Landing Page Copy

Ensure you maintain consistency in messaging through all elements of your digital marketing campaign, from ad impressions and email openings to the landing page and lead generation form. It drives more profound engagement with buyers and compels them to move further in their buying journey. Create a cohesive experience for visitors with two simple rules:

Focus on the right audience. While crafting your message, remember your audience persona and talk to that audience throughout your campaign.

##### Consistent Branding for Effective Marketing

- Use common elements like graphic style, fonts, slogans, and logos
- Ensure prospects can identify your brand across engagements
- Create a seamless transition between ad copy and landing pages

### 11\. Optimize for Organic Search

Landing pages are most associated with paid advertising campaigns, but they can contribute to organic traffic, too. Follow SEO copywriting best practices to maximize your chances of unlocking additional traffic opportunities.

##### Optimizing with Relevant Keywords

For a landing page, this includes identifying the keywords your ideal customers type into search engines. Once you’ve done this, you’ll want to use these keywords on your landing page, including in the header and body of the text. You’ll also want to use them in the page’s title tag and meta description.

### 12\. Test Run Before Launch

Creating an outstanding landing page is not a one-and-done process; it’s an ongoing journey of refinement and optimization. Before settling on a given landing page design and copy, embark on a [test run using A/B testing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing#:~:text=To%20run%20an%20A%2FB%20test%2C%20you%20need%20to%20create,better%20over%20a%20specific%20period.).

Experiment with different variations of your landing page elements such as:

- Headlines
- CTA buttons
- Color schemes
- Length of your copy

Analyze the performance of each version to gain valuable insights into what resonates most with your audience. Then, make data-driven decisions, improving your landing page until you see better results.

## 6 Examples of Landing Pages With Great Copy

![Landing Page Copywriting](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494778752932-64ee27ba2a37?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxvbiUyMGxhcHRvcHxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjEzNzIxNTh8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. HighriseHQ's Landing Pages

HighriseHQ’s landing pages are significant use cases of these customer testimonials. A key to their successful, high-converting landing pages is placing testimonials front and center, featuring a picture of the customer alongside a quote.

### 2\. Mixmax's Landing Page: Defined Value Propositions

Mixmax has devoted a section of this page to all the features that improve productivity, marked by a subheading that clearly states the value for customers: “Mixmax accelerates email productivity.” But they’ve also got a bunch of cool features that don’t necessarily support that benefit, so they’ve bucketed them under another subheading: “More reasons to love Mixmax.”

### 3\. ExpressVPN's Landing Page

The header is simple, with a headline and subheading featuring [easy-to-scan phrases](https://www.expressvpn.com/) like “VPN,” “just works,” and “#1.”

Further down the page, there’s a guide to getting started with a VPN that’s laid out in three simple steps:

1\. Sign up for ExpressVPN

2\. Download a VPN app

3.Connect to a VPN server location.

There’s a list of persuasive, scannable benefits like 24-hour live chat support and best-in-class encryption. Plenty of subheadings and bold text ensure users can see the most important points quickly.

### 4\. TeamGantt's Landing Page

TeamGantt uses a specific number to promote the benefits of their product: How effective would it be if they claimed to have millions of tasks scheduled? The number makes a big difference. Customers want specific information about the benefits and specific examples of what they will experience. Specificity is a powerful tool.

### 5\. Wistia's Landing Page: Engaging Users with Videos

The video on this Wistia landing page auto-plays to demonstrate the product features as soon as users land. The video immediately captures your attention, allowing Wistia to support its introductory copy with practical visuals.

## 7 Mistakes To Avoid in Landing Page Copywriting

![Landing Page Copywriting](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518644730709-0835105d9daa?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw5fHx0aGlua2luZyUyMGFib3V0JTIwbWlzdGFrZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjEzNzIxNzh8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Vague Headlines

Vagueness confuses visitors and causes them to lose interest quickly.

For example, instead of telling visitors you’ll help them “save money,” you might have a headline that says, “Cut Operational Expenses by 25%.” State your main promise or value proposition immediately, and use your audience research to write resonate headlines.

### 2\. Overusing Jargon

Avoid relying too much on niche industry-speak your average visitor may not grasp.

For instance, as a business, you may have “core competencies,” but there’s not much substance behind that phrase. State the specifics instead and share what you do best. Use plain, conversational language that visitors intuitively understand.

### 3\. Mismatched Messaging

Not all visitors will be interacting with your brand for the first time.

B2B decision-makers, for example, are using 10 different channels throughout their buyer’s journey, including:

- Social media
- Email
- In-person or digital events

Create a cohesive user experience on each channel to build brand recognition and ensure consistent messaging. For example, use a similar tone and language across your LinkedIn company page, marketing campaigns, and web pages. Get more tips for your B2B landing page here.

### 4\. Including Multiple Offers

Stick to promoting one core product/service per page.

For instance, if your company offers a suite of software products, create a separate landing page for each one. Too many competing offers overwhelm visitors and cause confusion that leads them to leave the page. Simplify and direct attention strategically.

### 5\. Overpromising

Make genuine claims backed by results and avoid exaggerated promises.

For example, don’t write in absolutes, like saying a customer will “never” experience a particular problem again. Everything you talk about on your landing page should align with the reality of what the potential customer can expect.

### 6\. Weak Call to Action

You know what you want your target audience to do on your landing page, but if you don’t clarify what’s in it for them, they won’t click. Try tapping into language that promotes urgency and highlighting your unique value proposition.

For example, “Download Report” isn’t as compelling as inviting visitors to click by having a CTA like “Get Your Free Report Now.”

### 7\. Failing to Optimize

Creating a landing page doesn’t end with copy and design. Make sure the page looks good across all devices and screen sizes to provide an experience that aligns with conversion rate optimization trends like personalization and fast loading times. Then, CRO audits should be conducted regularly to find opportunities for improvement.

For example, if people drop off once they get to a form, try changing or shortening the fields.
