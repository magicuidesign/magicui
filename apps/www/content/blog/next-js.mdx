#### Hybrid of Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation

Next.js offers a flexible approach by combining server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) in a single project. Developers can pre-render pages at build or request time based on the project's requirements.

#### TypeScript Support

Next.js comes with automatic TypeScript configuration and compilation support, making it easier for developers who prefer working with TypeScript.

#### Fast Refresh

The Fast Refresh feature lets Developers enjoy a fast, live-editing experience with Next.js. Edits made on React components are live within seconds, providing a smooth development experience akin to Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

#### CSS Parsers

Next.js allows developers to import CSS files directly from a JavaScript file, streamlining the handling of CSS within the project.

#### Built-in Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes images using its built-in Image Component, enhancing the website's overall performance.

#### Automatic Code Splitting

With Next.js, developers can automatically reduce the size of web pages by splitting the code and serving components only when needed. Modules can be imported dynamically, thanks to the dynamic import option.

#### Data Fetching

Next.js offers various options for data fetching, allowing developers to render content in different ways based on the application's use case. This can be achieved through pre-rendering with SSR or SSG or by updating/creating content with ISR.

### Cons

#### Development and Management

While Next.js provides immense flexibility, it requires continuous management to make desired changes efficiently. A dedicated person with the necessary knowledge is crucial to handle ongoing development tasks effectively.

#### Ongoing Cost

Since Next.js does not offer many built-in front pages, developers must create their front end, leading to ongoing costs. Hiring a front-end developer for periodic updates is a necessity.

#### Lack of Built-in State Manager

Next.js lacks a built-in state manager, so developers must rely on third-party solutions like Redux or MobX if state management is required in the application.

#### Low on Plugins

Next.js does not support a wide array of easy-to-adapt plugins, limiting the options available to developers for extending the framework's functionalities.
