## What Exactly Is A Website Header?

![Website Header Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502945015378-0e284ca1a5be?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw4fHx3ZWJzaXRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMDg2MDMwNnww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

A website header sits at the top of each page and serves several fundamental purposes. It provides more than a place for your logo; it is part of a consistent user experience that all good websites share. The design of a header may differ from site to site, but the core features that determine how a [site is navigated and experienced](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/getting-started-seo/what-is-a-website-header-and-why-you-should-use-it/) remain the same.

This section is usually consistent across all website pages; some designs give the home page a slightly different header appearance to draw attention to featured areas.

Headers are versatile canvases focusing on:

- CTA
- Brand
- Content
- Video
- Product

For instance, within a product-focused website header, the website name or logo might take a backseat, with the primary information about the product (such as ‘30% off today only!’) grabbing the spotlight. As headers can be used to advertise any messages or promotions, they offer many creative possibilities.

Design-wise, headers are typically displayed as a specific type, such as sticky or static. While you can choose either strategy, ensuring it aligns with your website's style and doesn’t impede users from reading the rest of your website comfortably is crucial. This caution and consideration in design choices are critical to a successful website.

## Types of Website Headers

Web designers have experimented with various website header designs, each serving different purposes, from branding to usability. Here are some of the most common types of website headers you might consider when designing a website:

### Static Website Header

A static website header doesn’t move and disappears when visitors scroll, prioritizing space and simplicity over navigational ease.

### Sticky Website Header

A sticky website header stays pinned to every web page, ensuring uninterrupted access to essential information.

### Full-Screen Website Header

A full-screen website header hides behind a menu icon and spans a device screen's entire width and height when it opens, creating a bold and visually engaging impact.

### Hidden Website Header

A hidden website header is concealed and only becomes visible when a user clicks on a hamburger menu button, optimizing screen space and enhancing the navigation experience.

### Vertical Website Header

In a vertical website header, the logo and other header elements are stacked vertically, creating a compact and streamlined presentation.

### Transparent Website Header

A transparent header has no solid background, integrating into the page and emphasizing the hero section.

### Hero Website Header

The hero header occupies the entire section above the fold, engaging users from when they land on your web page.

### Mega-Menu Website Header

Mega-menu headers provide extensive navigation options and subcategories through dropdown menus, which are suitable for websites requiring a broad range of navigation choices.

## Why Does Your Website Design Matter

![Website Header Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553877522-43269d4ea984?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHx3ZWJzaXRlJTIwZGVzaWduJTIwd2l0aCUyMHVpfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMDg2MDM1Nnww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

When designing a website, there are many factors to consider. However, the website header should be at the forefront of your mind. It's the initial point of contact for most visitors, and it should instantly convey your business's purpose and encourage them to engage.

### First Impressions Matter Most for Websites

Studies show that [94% of first impressions](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/15-essential-web-design-statistics-every-business-owner#:~:text=First%20impressions%20matter%2C%20especially%20when,explore%20your%20products%20or%20services.) about a website are design-related, so it’s important to put enough effort into your design that you’ll be able to keep website visitors from heading to a competitor’s site.

### Defining User Experience from the Start

The UX of this section defines how first-time visitors approach websites right from their arrival. A website's exploration ability largely depends on its header design and functionality.

### Clear Communication, Positive Interaction

Effective headers ensure visitors find what they’re looking for without confusion, [improving the site's overall usability](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-websites-user-experience). The speed at which people form initial responses cannot be overstated. A well-crafted header immediately communicates the purpose of your site, encouraging participation at various levels and leading to a positive user experience.

## Element of an Effective Website Header

### Company Branding

Ensure your logo and branding are consistent with your website's design. This makes your site recognizable and familiar to visitors.

### Call-to-Action (CTA)

Include a brief and straightforward [call-to-action](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-write-an-effective-call-to-action) in your header to prompt visitors to take a specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter or a free trial.

### Minimal Text

Keep your text in the header concise to prevent overwhelming visitors with information. A short slogan or product blurb may suffice.

### Navigation Tools

Incorporate essential navigation links in the header to help users easily access critical pages on your website.

### Search Bars

Include a search bar in your header to help visitors quickly find the information they need, keeping them engaged on your site.

### Shopping Cart

If your site features an online store, consider adding a shopping cart icon to the header to simplify the checkout process for shoppers.

### Login

A membership website should provide a smooth login experience for users. Include a login link in the header to help members access exclusive content easily.

### Social Media Links

If social media plays a significant role in your marketing strategy, consider adding [social media icons to the header](https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/6474611-website-builder-how-to-add-social-media-icons). This makes it easy for visitors to connect with your brand on social platforms.

### Languages

For a global audience, include a language menu in the header to accommodate visitors from diverse cultural backgrounds. This will enhance your website's accessibility and inclusivity.

## 25 Creative Website Header Examples To Inspire You

![Website Header Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540655037529-dec987208707?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHx5b3V0dWJlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMDg2MDM3NXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. The New York Times

The New York Times' fixed header is more complex than Tesla's or Nike's, but it still provides users with all the information they need to navigate the website.

### 2\. Google

Google's sticky header is an excellent example of using a sticky header to improve the user experience. The logo is large and prominently displayed, making it easy for users to identify the website.

### 3\. Webflow

[Webflow websites](https://www.numi.tech/post/webflow-websites) sticky header is similar to Google's, but it also includes a button that allows users to sign up for a free trial and contact the sales team.

### 4\. YouTube

YouTube’s header is a great way to keep users engaged and encourage them to watch more videos.

### 5\. Netflix

Netflix's header changes depending on your current activity. The header will show the movie's title and the remaining time if you are watching a movie. If you are browsing for movies, the header will show recommendations based on your viewing history.

### 6\. ESPN

ESPN's dynamic header changes depending on the current sporting event. If you watch a live game, the header will show the score, remaining time, and other relevant information. If you browse for highlights, the header lists the latest stories.

### 7\. Vogue

Vogue’s header is an excellent example of creating a minimal but functional and practical header.

### 8\. Reddit

Reddit's minimal header is even more stripped down than Vogue's. This is a great example of creating a minimal header that is still user-friendly.

### 9\. Slack

Slack is an excellent example of how to add a bit of personality to a minimal header. The buttons are colorful and eye-catching, making it easy for users to act.

### 10\. Adobe

Adobe's header is a great way to excite users about your products and services.

### 11\. Disney Plus

Disney Plus's full-screen header is another excellent example of using a full-screen header to showcase your content.

### 12\. Wendy Ju

As a product designer, Wendy Ju uses her online portfolio to showcase her knack for creating a good user experience. With a short vertical menu on the right and her logo on the left, the site is well-balanced and easy to navigate. The menu and logo float out of view when viewers move past the above-the-fold section, but they reappear with an upward scroll.

###  13. Generation She

Generation She fits a wider variety of elements in its header than normal without overwhelming visitors with a cluttered design. The header features the nonprofit’s modern logo, a well-structured navigation menu, and a compelling CTA. This thoughtful arrangement ensures easy access to critical information and encourages user engagement.

### 14\. Dopple Press

As Dopple Press demonstrates, a hero website header is a great way to make a strong visual impact. The header design cleverly incorporates the printer's natural paper stock as the background, instantly establishing a connection to the brand's core product. The printer's logo is front and center in the header, showing the brand’s personality. To the right, a colorful cartoon mascot adds a playful element to the overall design, capturing visitors' attention. On the left side of the header, a unique menu icon with a spinning hover effect stands out.

#### Engaging Users with Interactive Design

This interactive element adds excitement and invites visitors to explore further. When clicked, the icon reveals a full-screen navigation menu incorporating three soy ink colors used by Dopple Press in its printing processes.

### 15\. Festela

The website header design prioritizes legibility without sacrificing aesthetics. The static bar makes navigation easy for visitors, regardless of where they are on the site. The designer uses an electric blue hue for the navigation buttons and the logo to give the header a clean, ideal appearance that prioritizes legibility.

#### Language Options Reflect Global Reach and Local Pride

The Barcelona-based store has two language options in the right corner of the header: English and Catalan. This thoughtful inclusion caters to international customers while demonstrating the retailer’s pride in its Catalan roots.

### 16\. Aurelio de Anda

Adding text to your website’s header is a great way to give your viewers a personal or professional message from the start. In this example, the message appears as a ticker banner at the very top. The designer’s name spans the page width in a large, monolinear font. To its right, a music player adds to the browsing experience, and the two most essential links appear as brightly colored buttons. Underlined anchors to different homepage parts appear beneath the designer’s name in a fine serif font.

### 17\. Canva

This full-screen header is a great way to introduce users to Canva and to encourage them to try it out.

### 18\. Tesla

Tesla's fixed header features the company's logo, a search bar, and a few navigation links.

### 19\. Nike

Nike's fixed header is similar to Tesla's, but it also includes CTA.

### 20\. The Believer

Their header features the magazine name in its font, surrounded by pastel colors. Instead of a standard navigation menu, icons appear on the left-hand side. A larger menu slides out when clicked.

### 21\. Di Rosa Center for Contemporary Art

This California-based art museum keeps its header simple, surrounded by white space. This makes the text easy to read and navigate. Further, the header design never clashes with the art displayed on the site. This is especially true when contrasted with the museum’s promo for its maximalism exhibit.

### 22.  Katie Mai

Katie Mai's website header features her logo, which is a circle with her name in vibrant colors. There are only six links below in the same font and consistent colors. When you hover over a link, the item changes color. Katie Mai has a concise header that ensures that visitors can quickly navigate her website.

### 23\. Conti di San Bonifacio

This transparent header only has a white logo in the left corner and a white hamburger menu icon in the right. At the top of every page is a video or image rich in color that contrasts well with the white. Since the site is so heavy in visuals, the header’s visibility is rarely compromised.

### 24\. Target

[Target](https://www.target.com/c/college-storage-organization-back-to/-/N-5tf7e) is another website that uses animation to bring focus to its navigation. With this one, we get a smooth gliding animation as the second-level navigation slides open. We also get a fading effect. However, this one applies to the page and not to the navigation.

### 25\. Florida Aquarium 

When a visitor hovers over one of the main navigation links, the rest fade out. That’s the first animation effect that helps users focus on the available content. Then, when they hover over the secondary or tertiary level of links, the hovered page turns a different color than the rest. If you are interested in animations, you can easily use Magic UI's animated library for great animations.

## 5 Best Practices For Designing A Website Header

Designing an effective website header requires thoughtful consideration and clever strategies to optimize the limited space available. Following these best practices can help you create a captivating, user-friendly header, and aligned with your brand identity.

### 1\. Use clear, readable fonts

Since the header is the northern star of your site navigation, you must balance representing your brand identity and maximizing readability. After all, the purpose of the text in your header is to guide your audience. It can detract from the overall user experience if it's difficult to decipher. Therefore, opt for a font that is legible in a variety of sizes. Color can also hinder readability, so choose [high-contrast color schemes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169814108000693) for the font and background.

### 2\. Assess the header’s design

While there is no universal template for a perfect header design, it's essential to maintain a sense of fluidity throughout your webpage. While it should never go unnoticed, ensure your header’s size doesn’t interfere with the rest of your page’s content.

### 3\. Be Consistent

Consistency is vital when it comes to visual elements within the header. Ensure that the color scheme, imagery, and font align with the overall design of your website. This cohesiveness enhances the user experience by providing a visually unified and familiar interface.

### 4\. Include a clear call to action

If it’s essential for your business’s success, you’d be missing out if you didn’t include an effective call-to-action button on your header for everyone to see. For example, an eCommerce website can have a call-to-action button that reads Shop Now in its header. Or, in the case of a nonprofit website, the header is an excellent place to encourage visitors with a Donate button. Ensure your message is enticing, straightforward, and can be summed up in one or two words.

### 5\. Add animation

Hover effects and trigger animations in website headers provide visual feedback, which is crucial for user experience. They can also help capture visitors' attention and encourage them to interact with the header.

When implementing hover effects and trigger animations in your website headers, check that the effects are subtle, purposeful, and consistent with the overall design of your website. They should enhance the user experience without causing distractions or slowing down your website's performance. [Magic UI](https://pro.magicui.design/docs/templates/startup) helps you easily add these animations without disrupting UX.

## 4 Common Mistakes To Avoid While Designing A Website Header

![Website Header Examples](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522152302542-71a8e5172aa1?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHx3b3JraW5nJTIwYWxvbmUlMjBpbiUyMG9mZmNlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMDg2MDM5Mnww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Overcrowding the Header

Overcrowding the header with too many elements can overwhelm users, making it challenging for them to locate the information or navigation options they need. This can [increase bounce rates,](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/website-bounce-rate/332439/) as visitors may leave the site out of frustration.

### 2\. Using Hidden Navigation Menus

Hidden navigation menus, often represented by the hamburger icon, can create a cleaner look but hinder site usability. Less tech-savvy visitors might not immediately recognize this symbol as a menu, slowing down the navigation process as users take longer to find essential links.

### 3\. Failing to Optimize for Mobile Devices

Failing to optimize the header for mobile devices is a critical oversight as a significant portion of web traffic comes from mobile users. A header that does not adjust to smaller screens can lead to poor layout display, unreadable text, and inaccessible navigation links, affecting user interaction and search engine rankings.

### 4\. Using High-Resolution Images and Complex Animations

Incorporating too many high-resolution images or complex animations in the header can affect site performance by increasing [page load times](https://www.hostinger.ph/tutorials/website-speed-optimization#:~:text=Images%20can%20make%20your%20website,fast%20access%20to%20web%20content.). Longer loading times can lead to user impatience and site abandonment, reducing the site’s ability to retain visitors.
