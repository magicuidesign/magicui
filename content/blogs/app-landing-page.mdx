### 1\. Amazon Music

Amazon Music shows that even with big players like Spotify and Apple Music around, they’re not afraid of sluggishly competing in the music streaming marketplace. This app landing page entices new customers with a sweet deal and showcases their benefits in a way that differentiates them from competitors.

- On its app landing page, Amazon Music mentioned that it has the “most ad-free top podcasts” and that you can start and skip “any song, ad-free.”
- They also throw a little shade at Tidal, saying you can “listen in HD, with no extra cost.” Their messaging goes the extra mile to do some differentiating.

### 2\. Uber

Booking a ride with Uber has become second nature to many of us, and its landing page plays a significant role. You’ll first notice the bold, contrasting color scheme that captures attention and conveys a sense of efficiency.

- Its uncluttered, interactive design with a layout emphasizing key features (ride options, safety measures, and pricing) makes it easy for users to scan and understand the app’s benefits quickly.
- It also includes social proof through customer ratings and reviews, showcasing the app’s reliability and trustworthiness.
- The CTA is prominently displayed, with the option to download the app for both iOS and Android users.

### 3\. Slack

- The layout is well-structured, with a clear hierarchy that guides users through the page.
- Slack places its CTAs at the top and bottom of the page, making it easy for users to act at any point while scrolling.

- It’s not always possible to highlight everything your app does, but clever use of animation or video can showcase either functionality or results.
- Cameo provides a sample from “Mr. Wonderful” himself, Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary. Another video, showing a fan’s reaction to a message from Cody Ko, is even more powerful.

### 5\. FitnessAI

Getting into weightlifting can be intimidating. It's hard not to feel like a total dork when flanked by people pumping iron with bulging biceps who know what they're doing.

- This app landing page is a portal to setting up an account, downloading the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play, and seeking customer support.
- Being a part of Square means that Cash App doesn’t have to make a case for itself like newer companies that have yet to prove themselves. This allows them to keep things short with a stripped-down design that only has what’s necessary.
- Cash App’s web design could have been straightforward and unembellished. But there’s enough visual pizzazz to capture your attention. The blinking money symbol while loading and the moving visuals of the landing page keep things interesting.

### 7\. BrightLock

Imagine pointing the light on your phone at a locked door and having it click open. This may seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, but this is a technology of today.

The design feels effortless with a logical structure and large blocks of content.

- Several scroll-triggered animations bring a lively energy to the user experience.
- The web design uses interactions to demonstrate how ArriveSafe works in 3 steps, allowing users to engage and learn more. This is a great example of a designer doing the extra work to create a more compelling user experience.

### 20\. Acorns

Is there a better name for an investment app that lets you stow away little chunks of money for a reward on a later day than Acorns? With oak leaves and a quaint little acorn of a logo, this web design doesn’t overdo it with the theme — and that’s a good thing. Showing a bit of restraint makes for a more focused design.

- Along with the clear lines of the design are several screenshots.
- Some are flat, and others show angled smartphones.

An app landing page is a crucial asset for a mobile application at every stage of its life cycle.

- [Before the launch](https://blog.getsocial.im/how-to-launch-an-app-a-15-step-guide-to-a-successful-app-launch/), it is a platform to gauge audience engagement and interest before the product release.
- During the launch phase, it becomes a crucial tool for advertising and promoting the app for installation.
- After the app is launched, the landing page plays a significant role by keeping users interested in the application and providing detailed information that may not be readily available on platforms like Google Play or the App Store.

### Benefits of Having an App Landing Page

There are several key benefits to having a landing page for your mobile application.

- It allows you to tap into search traffic, significantly increasing the number of downloads over time.

## What Are The Benefits Of Landing Pages For Apps?

![App Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1616628188859-7a11abb6fcc9?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxzdGlja3klMjBub3Rlc3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjE0NTg3OTJ8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Landing pages are vital tools in your marketing arsenal when promoting mobile apps. Here are some perks of building a landing page to promote your app.

### More Conversions

Landing pages allow you to speak more directly to your target audience and steer them towards your call to action. This direct approach often results in more app downloads than sending visitors to a regular download page.

### Create Fully Branded Experiences

Rather than being stuck with the generic look of app store pages, landing pages let you create a [branded experience that excites potential users](https://builtin.com/articles/app-marketing-tactics) about your app. A well-designed landing page can compellingly present your brand, boosting your app's initial impact.

### Provide More Precise Messaging

With a landing page, you have more space to persuade potential customers than app store pages. You can delve into your app's features and benefits, include testimonials, or add trust signals like review scores.

### Keep Users in Your Ecosystem

App store pages can redirect potential customers to similar apps from other developers, potentially losing you a customer. Landing pages help keep users focused on your app, providing links to educational resources if they need more info before downloading.

### Control Your Call to Action

Landing pages let you control your call to action, making it specific to your app and brand. You can tailor the messaging to reflect your app's unique value, giving you an edge over generic messages like "Download" or "Get" on app store pages.

### Target the Right Audience

Landing pages help you direct your messaging towards the right audience, ensuring that your app appeals to the most likely to download it. By targeting your audience precisely, you can craft a compelling pitch that resonates with potential users.

## How To Build Mobile App Landing Pages

![App Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1629904853893-c2c8981a1dc5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHxkZXZlbG9wZXJ8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzIxNDU4ODEzfDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Establish Your Conversion Goal First

Before rolling up your sleeves and designing your app landing page, you need to [set a clear conversion goal](https://www.abconvert.io/blog/mastering-conversion-goals-a-comprehensive-guide-to-boosting-your-websites-performance). What action do you want your visitors to take on that page? Do you want them to download your app directly? Would you prefer to subscribe to your service first? Or they may need to purchase a product for the app to work correctly. Your conversion goal shapes your calls-to-action, copy, design, and more. So, before anything else, decide what this goal is.

### Start with Mobile

Since apps are created primarily for mobile phones, designing your mobile version first makes sense. Most of your visitors will visit this page via mobile anyway, so why not prepare for them first? Plus, it’s generally easier to create a desktop version from a mobile one than the other way around.

### Keep Their Attention

This is true of all landing pages, but app landing pages that aim for direct downloads should have a 1:1 attention ratio. Don’t overwhelm your visitors with too much information; instead, give them the essentials they need to convert. Use bullet points, headings, and short paragraphs to keep things scannable.

### Show the Device

Show your app running on a device that’s as similar as possible to what your users have. This could be an iPhone, an Android phone, or another device based on your target audience. This visual cue helps visitors picture themselves using your app and hit that download button. And keep your visuals fast-loading – a slow post-click experience can frustrate users and tank your conversions.

### Stay Fast

Don’t let a heavy page slow you down. It can be tempting to throw in every app feature and detail, but visitors may bounce if your page takes more than a few seconds to load. Keep your pages fast and easy to navigate to increase your chances of converting visitors into users.

### Clear and Compelling Headlines

Your headline is the first thing users see on your mobile app landing page. Make it punchy, clear, and irresistible. Think of it as the billboard for your new app – it’s got to hook them in fast.

### Engaging Visuals

Humans are visual creatures, so play to the gallery. Use high-quality images or videos that reflect your app's vibe.

### Concise Copy

Keep your copy concise and to the point. Highlight benefits, not just features, and make every word earn its place.

### Strong Call-to-Action (CTA)

Your CTA is your “ask,” so don't mumble. Whether it's ‘Download Now,’ ‘Get Started,’ or ‘Learn More,’ make it [loud and clear](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/call-to-action/). And please, for the love of conversion, make that download link pop!

### Fast Load Times

You're done if your page loads like a sloth climbing a tree. Speed is key. Ensure your landing page loads quickly to keep those first few potential customers, paying customers, and users on the hook.

### Mobile Optimization

This is a mobile app landing page, so if it isn’t optimized for your mobile devices, that’s a facepalm moment. Ensure it looks just as stunning on a smartphone as on a desktop app.

### Social Proof

People trust other people more in investment apps than they trust marketing spiels. Include reviews, customer testimonials or, or user numbers to cash app downloads to show that real humans love your app.

### A/B Testing

Don't just guess what works – test it. Use [A/B testing to fine-tune your landing page](https://www.semrush.com/blog/a-b-testing-landing-pages/). Change one element at a time and measure. Rinse and repeat.

### Analytics

Plug in your analytics tools and monitor what happens. How long do people stay? What do they click? Use data to make decisions, not just gut feelings.

### Continuous Optimization

Keep refining and updating your app landing pages based on user feedback and analytics. The world changes fast, and so should your app landing page examples, too.

## How To Retarget Website Visitors For Higher Conversions

![App Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556155092-490a1ba16284?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxhbmFseXRpY3N8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzIxNDU4ODM2fDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Retargeting your landing page visitors is a powerful strategy to re-engage those who have shown interest in your mobile app but have yet to convert. To begin, assess visitors who have interacted with the content. Then, create a custom audience based on these potential users.

### Reignite Interest

Design a visually appealing and compelling ad that aligns with the content and messaging of the landing page these individuals previously viewed. Emphasize the [app's unique selling points](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/unique-selling-point-USP) and highlight any special offers or features to entice them further. The ad should link to the next stage in the funnel; depending on the landing page content, this might be an event or newsletter registration or directly sending the viewer to an app store.

### Targeted Engagement

If your landing page audience can be further segmented, this is the perfect opportunity to create more personalized ads and A/B test what works well for conversion. The key is to test, learn, and optimize continually.
