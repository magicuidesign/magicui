## Challenges Associated With Using React Native

![React Native Libraries](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/n8of9xyvd69.jpg)

### 1\. Lack of Some Custom Modules

One of the main challenges of using React Native in projects is the lack of ready-to-use modules that provide access to APIs for both Android and iOS. This means developers often have to create Native Modules or develop bridges using Java/Kotlin for Android or Swift/Objective-C for iOS. This process significantly increases the software development time and can be a frustrating hurdle for developers looking to implement certain features quickly.

### 2\. Lower Performance

Another disadvantage of using React Native is the potential decline in performance due to using bridges or custom modules. By integrating these additional components, the app might experience delays or lags, which could affect the overall user experience. Developers must carefully consider the balance between functionality and performance when utilizing React Native in their projects.

### 3\. Debugging Issues

Debugging React Native apps can become tedious, as they are built with a combination of [different programming languages](https://www.simplilearn.com/best-programming-languages-start-learning-today-article), including C/C++, Java, and JavaScript. This requires developers to have a strong understanding of each language and platform to troubleshoot issues that may arise during the development process effectively. Due to the complex nature of React Native apps, debugging can be time-consuming and challenging without the proper expertise and experience.

## Installing A React Native Library

![React Native Libraries](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/q0jrjdl4z3.jpg)

React Native libraries are typically installed from the npm registry, which offers a versatile choice of package managers, such as npm CLI or Yarn Classic, all powered by Node.js.

If you have Node.js installed on your computer, you already have the npm CLI installed. Some developers prefer to use Yarn Classic for slightly faster install times and additional advanced features like Workspaces. Both tools work great with React Native. For simplicity of explanation, we will assume npm for the rest of this guide.

To install a library in your project, navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run the installation command. Let's try this with react-native-webview:

    ```
    npm install react-native-webview
    ```

The library that we installed includes native code, and we need to link to our app before we use it.

### Linking Native Code on iOS

React Native uses CocoaPods to manage iOS project dependencies and most React Native libraries follow this same convention. If a library you are using does not, please refer to their README for additional instruction. In most cases, the following instructions will apply.

Run `pod install` in our iOS directory to link it to our native iOS project. A shortcut for doing this without switching to the iOS directory is to run `npx pod-install`.

    ```
    npx pod-install
    ```

Once this is complete, re-build the app binary to start using your new library:

    ```
    npm run ios
    ``

### Linking Native Code on Android

React Native uses Gradle to manage Android project dependencies. After you [install a library](https://reactnative.dev/docs/libraries#:~:text=You%20can%20install%20a%20particular,netinfo%40%5E2.0.0%20.) with native dependencies, you will need to re-build the app binary to use your new library:

    ```
    npm run android
    ```
