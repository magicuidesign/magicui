Ready to elevate your design? Let's get started.

## What Is a Landing Page?

![Creative Landing Page Design](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/xj3xsd52aa.jpg)

A landing page is designed to turn site visitors into leads or customers. Most landing pages usually feature personalized content and a clear call-to-action (CTA) to encourage users to take the desired action, such as:

- Filling out a contact form
- Downloading content
- Purchasing

Its primary function is to direct visitors towards the call-to-action (CTA).

### Landing Pages for Maximum Impact

A website can have multiple landing pages. For example, you may create different landing pages to test out different messaging or layouts and see which version your visitors respond to the most. You can also create different landing pages to send visitors through a series of choices to land on a tailored CTA (this is known as a click funnel.)

### Landing Pages That Sell

Landing pages educate your visitors and use compelling content to transform them into clients. They also serve as a representation of your website and your business. For example, in most cases, a landing page is the first thing a visitor will see after clicking on an ad. While it may be your audience's first page, a landing page differs from a web page's focus on conversion and lead generation.

### Landing Pages Designed to Convert

A landing page stands alone, often at the forefront of a homepage, and serves a single purpose: getting your visitors to give you their contact information. Landing pages have limited navigation and direct visitors to a call to action. They give your offer or promotion a place to live and act as a gate to your coveted materials.

## Why You Need the Element of Creativity in Your Landing Pages

![Creative Landing Page Design](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/xt2qqw7r2a.jpg)

Creativity is a fundamental factor in high-converting landing pages. It inspires users to take action and ensures their needs and preferences are met. While usability is the main element of a good landing page, the user experience truly matters. Two factors that must coexist to bring the best results:

- Creativity
- User experience

### Why Landing Pages Need Creativity

Take a look at the data to better understand the importance of creativity in crafting landing pages. Studies show that 50% of users won’t recommend a [poorly designed landing page](https://landingi.com/landing-page/creative-examples/#:~:text=According%20to%20KlientBoost%2C%2050%25%20of,can%20affect%20higher%20conversion%20rates.), and 38% will stop engaging with a page they consider unattractive.

### Brand Identity & User Experience

Your landing page’s design can affect higher conversion rates. If your brand visual identity complements well-suited landing page colors and typography, includes visuals that represent high quality and has visible but not flashy CTAs, you are on the right track.

### Beauty & Usability for Modern Landing Pages

Today's internet users don't just appreciate well-designed pages; they expect them. They crave pages that are not only visually appealing but also designed with user experience in mind. Web designers must meet this demand to stay competitive in the digital realm.

## 6 Elements of a Creative Landing Page Design

![Creative Landing Page Design](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/jlijwhehly.jpg)

### 1\. Catchy Headlines That Grab Attention

When it comes to creative landing page design, one of the most crucial elements is crafting a catchy headline that [grabs the visitor's attention](https://optinmonster.com/700-power-words-that-will-boost-your-conversions/) instantaneously. Your headline should be around ten words short and convey the purpose of your page to the visitor.

#### Crafting Effective HeadlinesUse numbers for impact

- Be specific and clear
- Choose solid and resonant words
- Set the tone for the landing page

### 2\. Eyeflow Design for a Neat and User-Friendly Landing Page

Maintaining an organized and visually appealing layout on your landing page is essential for keeping visitors engaged. Categorize your content logically and complement it with high-quality images or videos that align with your brand aesthetic.

#### Design for Conversions, Not Clutter

Avoid overcrowding the page with too many colors and elements, as this can make it look cluttered and distract visitors from the key message. Instead, focus on using neutral colors, contrast, white space, and directional cues to guide visitors' attention to your call-to-action (CTA) button.

### 3\. Short and Sweet Writing to Keep Visitors Engaged

When writing the content for your landing page, less is more. Keep your text concise, aiming for 250-300 words unless you're dealing with a complex product or service. Shorter text is easier to read and understand, ensuring visitors quickly grasp the value proposition.

#### Why This Matters to You

Focus on explaining why your offer matters to them and how it can benefit their lives or businesses. Being direct and to the point in your writing will help keep visitors engaged and increase the likelihood of conversion.

### 4\. Craft a Compelling Call to Action (CTA) to Prompt Action

A landing page's success hinges on its ability to encourage visitors to take action, and a [compelling call-to-action (CTA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call-action-cta.asp) is the key to achieving this. Make sure to include one or more clear CTA buttons that tell visitors precisely what you want them to do next. Place these buttons strategically on the page, significantly above the fold, so they're immediately visible.

#### Action-Oriented Words to Boost Engagement

- Sign up
- Get Started
- Download
- Register Now

### 5\. Unique Value Proposition (UVP) to Differentiate Your Offering

Your landing page should communicate your Unique Value Proposition (UVP), which sets your product or service apart from the competition. Craft a concise and clear statement that explains how your offering solves customers' needs and why they should choose you over other options in the market. Your UVP should resonate with your target audience and convince them that your product or service is the best solution to their pain points or challenges.

### 6\. Ease of Navigation for a Seamless User Experience

Incorporating intuitive navigation on your landing page is essential for providing visitors with a smooth user experience. A clean, straightforward layout with minimal distractions helps visitors focus on the key message and navigate the page effortlessly.

#### Guiding Visitors to Action

Ensure that the design elements are laid out logically, directing visitors' attention toward the CTA button and guiding them through the conversion process smoothly. A well-structured landing page enhances user engagement and increases the likelihood of conversion.

## 45 Examples Of Creative Landing Page Design To Inspire Your Creation

![Creative Landing Page Design](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/tyt6re1jb6.jpg)

### 1\. Langfuse Landing Page Design Example: Navigating the Animation Realm

Langfuse's landing page uses animated components to bring it to life. It is built with [Magic UI](https://pro.magicui.design/docs/templates/startup), which allows easy access to animated components. The page is clean, with a minimalistic design and a clear call to action, making it easy for visitors to navigate and take their desired action.

### 2\. DoorDash

Food delivery is big business; companies like DoorDash use landing pages to get more drivers to sign up for their service. This page helps you visualize what delivering food for a living will be like and highlights how much money you could make with your new full-time gig or side hustle.

#### Freedom You Crave, Delivered 

What’s the most significant advantage of being a food delivery person? It’s not that you’ll learn every traffic shortcut in your city, nor is it the delicious smell of food that permeates your vehicle (10 years later, my car still smells like pepperoni pizza). The most significant advantage is the freedom you get. You can work your hours and be your own boss. And this landing page nails that feeling right in the headline.

### 3.  Muzzle

Muzzle, a Mac app that silences on-screen notifications, fully embraces this show-and-tell mentality on their otherwise minimal landing page. Landing pages help users decide whether or not your product or service is worth their precious time and energy.

What better way to communicate your value proposition clearly and straightforwardly than by confronting visitors with the problem your app solves?

### 4\. AirBnB 

This AirBnB landing page is a one-stop shop for visitors curious about where to book a holiday rental. It features several options, such as:

- Beachfront
- Cabins
- Views

Once a user clicks, they can:

- Easily view the potential home
- Read testimonials
- View the pricing

What’s even better is that a user can select a date to book on the same page and convert on the spot if the information is convincing.

### 5\. Netflix

The streaming giant’s landing page is short, sweet, and straightforward, including only the necessary details. It makes it extremely easy for users to complete the page's goal of entering their email address to get started with a [Netflix membership](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/412).

A single-field form above the page fold makes starting with Netflix seem effortless. The copy is succinct, states the brand’s value proposition, and clarifies that you can cancel anytime. It also includes details on introductory pricing upfront so users don’t have to search for them.

### 6\. Philosophy

Philosophy features skincare products and fragrances. Its landing page is arranged so scanning gives two opportunities to shop for skincare products or fragrances. If you are just browsing, you see two more shopping links every time you scroll down.

### 7\. Slack

Slack landing page example. It is always on top of its game when creating some of the best landing pages. They are constantly optimizing for conversions, which is the best way to find your winning landing page.

#### Beyond Messaging

What makes Slack’s landing page stand out is its messaging. The company doesn’t want you to consider Slack a messaging tool. Today, it’s so much more than that — and that’s what this landing page is trying to convey.

A key takeaway from Slack’s landing page is to keep your navigation bar bare. On this landing page, Slack only includes the most important elements in the navigation bar: letting current users log in and prospective users talk to sales.

### 8\. ExpressVPN

Virtual private networks (VPNs) add a layer of security to WiFi browsing, and [ExpressVPN](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/expressvpn-vpn-proxy-for/fgddmllnllkalaagkghckoinaemmogpe) has created a landing page that communicates safety and simplicity. The main headline promises visitors a seamless online experience, and the graphic of someone accessing a variety of digital experiences reinforces that message.

#### Engaging Content & Building Trust

As visitors scroll down, the text describes the service's chief benefits, accompanied by simple graphics that help make abstract concepts like “global access” more concrete. Given that ExpressVPN is a security tool, establishing credibility is essential.

This landing page achieves this without alienating visitors with muted graphics and simple language. Prominent TrustPilot and app store reviews further signal that the company is reputable.

### 9\. Blue Apron

Blue Apron aims to win new customers with a landing page emphasizing the variety of menu options available for Meal planning and ingredient delivery service. High-quality food photography entices visitors to keep scrolling, with content down the page emphasizing the service’s:

- Value
- Flexibility
- Convenience

#### Driving Conversions

The CTA remains consistent throughout, encouraging visitors to view plans and begin designing a subscription to suit their dietary preferences and schedule. Blue Apron could have cluttered this landing page with testimonials, menu examples, and recipe links, but it focused on its core messaging:

- Value
- Convenience

The landing page is relatively short (it only has four sections), but it intends to offer many features using cute graphics.

### 10\. LinkedIn Ads

This landing page outlines the benefits of advertising on LinkedIn to potential business customers. A fixed header menu with the CTA button “create an ad” stays anchored as visitors scroll through the content, and the button appears twice. In the middle of this landing page, visitors can click through a carousel presentation of the critical benefits of LinkedIn Ads.

The design allows each concept to shine without devouring too much screen real estate. The page concisely outlines the three-step ad launch process, signaling visitors won’t waste time with a cumbersome backend system.

### 11\. Hootsuite

Hootsuite is a social media management tool that helps marketers create, schedule, and track all their social content in a single dashboard. The landing page aligns with social media as a fun but legitimate marketing tool, with Hootsuite’s trademark cartoon owl sharing center stage with a photo of a youthful-looking customer.

#### Tiered CTA

The CTA, which is repeated throughout, invites visitors to start a 30-day free trial. Details about product benefits are shared in a space with a testimonial and a section displaying customer brand logos, which signal that the company has a track record of success. Hootsuite’s page starts with minimal text and an immediate CTA button for those who already know they want to get started.

As visitors scroll, each section of the page includes more detail, prioritizing describing tools for:

- Instagram
- TikTok, followed by
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Pinterest

Granular information on pricing and product benefits is displayed down the page, followed by a button for scheduling a demo for visitors who seek a deeper dive.

### 12\. Wondrium

The landing page for this streaming service uses a tiled background of movie title graphics to showcase the breadth of its offerings. A prominent CTA highlights a 14-day free trial offer. Testimonials from well-known Internet creators prove the service is worth exploring, while an FAQ proactively explains more details.

In keeping with Wondrium’s educational focus, a prominent FAQ details the service and reveals additional benefits, such as a quarterly magazine and audio-only streaming capabilities.

### 13\. Uber for Business

The popular ride-sharing business has expanded to offer a feature set specifically for businesses, such as:

- Ride services for company customers
- Helping employees track travel expenses

This squeeze [landing page](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/), reached from a Google search, gives companies a fast track to setting up an Uber account with the headline “Let’s get started.”

#### Brand Consistency with a Twist

Three succinctly-stated benefits on the right persuade visitors to take action, while the logo at the top links to a purpose-built microsite for further information if needed. While the page looks different from the typical Uber app experience, the typeface and black-and-white color scheme make it recognizable as part of the Uber brand.

#### Understanding User Behavior

Web design research shows that most users skim what’s on screen in a predictable pattern. Their eyes move across the page and down in a zigzag and “Z pattern,” or else straight down and then across to the right in an “F pattern.”

#### F-Pattern for Conversions

Uber’s page uses an F-pattern by placing “Uber for Business” in the top left corner. After that, your eye is drawn straight down to the CTA form, with the three horizontal bands to the right providing supplemental material to skim.

### 14\. Skillshare

This landing page design for online course provider SkillShare includes a navy blue background with text in high-contrast white and lime green. Tiled photos showcase the various course types available via the service, from cooking to computer skills. Using an F-pattern layout, the page uses the right-hand side to detail three key differentiators.

#### Multiple Login Options

The signup form requires just a name and email address to get started, and visitors can use existing social media logins integrated with the site.

By keeping the required fields to a minimum, Skillshare’s page encourages visitors to sign up for the service. Integrating with other login services makes the process even easier, allowing new customers to avoid remembering another username and password.

### 15\. Snowflake

This event page for a data service provider demonstrates a commitment to mingling informative content with networking and fun. Detailed descriptions, an agenda, and an interactive event finder give potential attendees all the information they need to find the right event. This straightforward page looks information-heavy, with minimal graphics and plenty of text.

#### A Different Approach for Data Analysts

While that’s the opposite of most landing pages, the wonky approach may be just right for a data analytics audience. By stating that events are sold out and inviting viewers to fill out the form to be placed on a waitlist, Snowflake signals that their events are worthwhile and exclusive. This positioning helps ensure that visitors who sign up will rush to register when another event invitation comes their way.

### 16\. Spatium

Different shades of purple and captivating images of outer space make it difficult not to install this Google Chrome extension on your computer. An abundance of blank space accentuates the limited text, creating an attractive and straightforward design.

#### A Winning CTA Combination

The CTA includes a reminder that the extension is free; for those who need more information, the page goes on to illustrate functionality with lush photos and to list widgets and options included with the download.

#### Frictionless Conversions

If the CTA can be accomplished quickly with little risk or cost to the visitor, there’s no need to over-elaborate. While you should spell out essential details (such as shipping costs for a product or which devices are compatible for a download), make the action as easy to take as possible, and be sure any checkout or download processes are similarly streamlined to keep visitors on track to completion.

### 17\. Beats by Dre

Landing pages allow retailers to elaborate on:

- Style elements
- Technical features
- Craftsmanship
- Other product details

#### Educating and Converting Buyers

To that end, this page dedicated to wireless headphones includes extensive information on sound quality, charging capabilities, and built-in functions. Large visuals and concise text spell out the benefits, while the “buy” button links directly to the shopping cart, shortening the path to purchase.

#### Keeping the CTA in Sight

Visitors can lose track of the initial CTA if a landing page is long. Repeating the button at several points throughout the page is one solution, but it’s more elegant to use a floating header that always anchors the button at the top of the screen, keeping it within reach.

### 18\. Inbound by Hubspot

This conference landing page makes it easy to secure tickets with a focused CTA and persuasive content that convinces visitors that the event is worth their time.

#### Showcasing Event Highlights

- Video presentations
- Event photos
- Speaker bios featuring expert talent

At the same time, delineated descriptions of the two available ticket types make it easy for visitors to select the right price point for them.

#### Avoiding Decision Fatigue for Conversions

While it can be tempting to show various price points and products to appeal to multiple tastes, having too many options can confuse and overwhelm viewers. By sticking to the two ticket types available to attendees who aren’t also exhibiting as vendors, HubSpot avoids complicating the selection and gives page visitors a binary choice.

### 19\. Masterclass

Online course provider Masterclass has set the standard for marquee instructors, and its offering for screenwriting is no exception. Oscar-winner Aaron Sorkin teaches the ins and outs of the trade.

#### Content and Conversion

For those who search for the class using Sorkin’s name, Masterclass has devised a landing page with his photo front and center and a simple red CTA that makes it straightforward to claim a class spot. Video preview clips and a course outline help visitors decide whether the content will meet their needs.

#### Attracting Celebrity Instructors

If you’re working with an influencer or have a celebrity connection, highlight their endorsement or credentials. Masterclass appeals to its target audience with this approach, attracting visitors who want to name-drop their instructors at cocktail parties.

#### Showcasing Expertise

The clean and straightforward design of the rest of the page concentrates attention on the celebrity, while the preview clip demonstrates why they’re worth paying for.

### 20\. Calm

Most of us could use more tranquility in our lives, and Calm aims to bring us exactly that. It’s a meditation and sleep app with features designed to invite relaxation into our otherwise chaotic lives. This landing page website example is the first thing people see once they visit the app’s site—right away, it encourages visitors to get started and engage more deeply with Calm.

#### Matching Design to Message

Calm practices what they preach through the look of their landing page. The copy is clean and straightforward to avoid overwhelming visitors with too much information. The headline, “Meet Calm,” lends a feeling of harmony and peace to the content.

#### Clear Value Proposition

Calm’s main goal is spelled out. (Better sleep, lower stress, and less anxiety? Sign me up!) The landing page gets straight to the point by inviting the reader to join millions of others around the globe on their path to wellness.

### 21\. Zola

Zola is the latest startup that’s breaking the mold regarding wedding planning. Their philosophy is simple: Make it easy for couples to plan their big day, from the invitations through the honeymoon.

From an online wedding registry to a directory of wedding venues and vendors, Zola is a one-stop shop for brides and grooms-to-be. The first word we read on the landing page is free, immediately having a powerful effect on future brides and grooms who want to save on wedding costs but still get a polished-looking product.

### 22\. CD Baby

CD Baby is a music distributor that gets your tracks to the ears of the masses. The platform aims to help independent musicians get on all the top platforms to get the widest distribution. Not only that, CD Baby wants to make sure that musicians are receiving the royalties they deserve.

The landing page explains why musicians benefit from CDBaby's service (beyond getting their music out there as much as possible). CDBaby does it all for one price, so musicians know exactly what they get.

### 23\. Goby

Brushing perfected. That’s what this landing page from Goby promises right at the top, giving visitors the confidence and curiosity to click through. Not only does their award-winning electric toothbrush come with impressive accolades, but it’s also affordable and backed up by a money-back guarantee.

Now that’s worth a smile! Check out the section of the page that breaks down every element of the toothbrush. Rather than just talk about these features in the copy, visitors can see the:

- Soft, Premium Bristles
- Oscillating Brush Head

### 24\. Salt & Straw

Salt & Straw Curiously Delicious Ice Cream Delivered Right to Your Door rewards lead capture with a subscription to their monthly newsletter with information about:

- New flavor launches
- Special offers
- Coupons for partner shops
- 10% off the customer's first order

The visual on their landing page is:

- Simple
- Memorable
- Yummy

It's scoops of ice cream flanked by rows of ripe summer berries.

### 25\. SEM Rush

If you’re a digital marketer, you’re probably already familiar with SEM Rush. Their platform offers an [all-in-one toolkit](https://www.semrush.com/company/) for:

- SEO
- Content marketing
- PPC
- Social media
- Market research

But rather than try to sell you all of these things simultaneously, this landing page narrows its focus on just one thing: how to use its platform to learn more about your competitors.

The CTA on this page taps into every marketer’s innate desire to spy on the competition. The one-field form asks you to enter any domain name before prompting you to click the big button and “Get Insights.”

### 26\. Coco Village

The marketers at J7 Media, a Facebook Ads agency, did a phenomenal job creating a landing page showcasing a collection of different products while still keeping it focused on a single click-through goal.

#### Bold Discounts Drive Conversions

When offering a big sale or discount, you want everyone to know about it. And visitors on this landing page can’t miss that they’re offering “50% Off Beds and Bedding Sets.” Not only is that the main headline, but it’s also repeated under each product on every CTA. They even strikethrough the original prices to illustrate how much money you’ll be saving. Nice!

### 27\. Grass Roots

There’s a growing demand for grass-fed meat, which is where this landing page from the Grass Roots Farmers’ Cooperative and the agency MuteSix comes into the mix. As you scroll through the page, you’re taken on the full customer journey—from problem awareness (understanding why grass-fed meat is better), through consideration (seeing why you should choose Grass Roots as your protein provider), to making a purchase (“Claim Your $30 Off”).

#### Building Trust & Urgency for Premium Meat

At the top of the page is a one-minute video featuring Dave Asprey, the founder and CEO of Bulletproof. The video explains how challenging it can be to source high-quality grass-fed meat and why Dave uses Grass Roots for the meat he can’t find in the grocery store. This sets the tone nicely for the rest of the page and gives you the right mindset to purchase.

### 28\. Amazon

Here’s a landing page that, on paper, doesn’t seem to work at all. The colors are incredibly disjointed, and there are multiple different art styles. The content seems to be all over the place. The page even has multiple links to other pages and exit points.

#### When Benefits Trump Design Rules

Amazon somehow manages to get away with breaking all of these rules because they know their offer is too good to pass up. Ask people why they signed up for Amazon Prime, and they’ll answer you in the same order these sections appear on the landing page. Free shipping is the main benefit, followed by Prime Video.

#### Click-Through CTAs

The rest are bonuses, shown as add-ons as you get farther down the page. (With the average scroll depth only about 50%, it’s smart to put the most important stuff in the top half of the page.) Whether you consider this a SaaS page or an ecommerce page, the marketers at Amazon made the right call to use a click-through CTA instead of embedding a form on the page. According to the Unbounce Conversion Benchmark Report, click-through CTAs perform better in both industries.

### 29\. Branch Furniture

As someone who had to furnish a home office recently, I know exactly how difficult it can be to find desks, chairs, and tables you like online. Branch Furniture understands this can be a problem for office managers, so their landing page instantly reassures you that you’re in the right place.

#### "Easy" Office Furniture

Their service makes it easy to get your office furniture designed, shipped, and installed. “Office Furniture Made Easy.” In just four words, you understand who this landing page is trying to target and what their unique selling proposition (USP) is. You don’t want to be building 100 desks for your new office Ikea-style, with nothing but a socket wrench and a dream. It seems like a much better idea to let Branch Furniture handle all those details for you.

### 30\. Western Rise

Sometimes when prepping a piece like this one, you end up buying the product. I’m very, very close to pulling the trigger on a pair of Western Rise’s AT Slim Rivet Pants. And why not? This sharp landing page quickly establishes the appeal of the product through visuals and copy that stresses the benefits of these “elevated” pants. It may be time to give up on my ratty jeans altogether.

#### Evoking a Lifestyle

These pants may be handmade in Los Angeles, but many of the photos here (including the hero shot) scream Brooklyn. It’s easy to imagine wearing the AT Slim Rivet Pants as you peddle your fixie through traffic, balancing a latte on your handlebars on the way to a chic rooftop cocktail party.

### 31\. Athabasca University

Athabasca University pioneered distance education in Canada in the 1970s. Today, it uses landing pages to boost its online enrolment initiatives, including this example representing its 14 certificate programs. It’s a smart choice since landing pages allow AU to focus a visitor’s attention on a particular slice of its many online program offerings.

#### Hitting the Right Audience

It might be worth testing out a more direct headline, but the copy here matches the school’s other branding initiatives elsewhere. It’s also very sharp. The target is clear: people who might further their education but don’t feel they have time to pursue it. This landing page says otherwise (in words and in its hero image).

### 32\. Bariatric Eating

Here’s a page for Bariatric Eating that shows why personality and style are so important to your landing page. You can easily imagine a version of this campaign that looks much more clinical and scientific. Still, the marketers at Sevah Creative have infused it with a colorful and friendly design to make the subject matter much more approachable. The approach is working, too.

#### A Conversion Magnet

This page has an impressive conversion rate of over 39%. The playful design extends to every element of the page. The font choices, the illustrations, the colors—everything comes together in a way that perfectly matches their brand personality.

### 33\. blow LTD.

If you look past the buzzy “Uber for beauty” thing, UK brand blow LTD. solves a genuine problem in a genius way. They offer affordable, professional beauty services that come to you, and—more importantly—you can book an appointment with one of their pros straight from their app. Smartly, landing pages are a big part of their campaign strategy. The example, for instance, promotes in-home eyelash extensions in clever ways.

#### Headline Clarity Wins Conversions

This landing page doesn’t mess around with cute copy (e.g., “Eyes That Amaze”). Instead, it clearly states the offer and relies on value (and maybe a little bit of novelty) to win over prospective customers. A promise doesn’t get more unambiguous than “Eyelash Extensions At Home,” and that’s precisely why this headline is so effective.

### 34\. Blue Forest Farms

Hemp farmers sometimes have trouble disassociating themselves from cannabis culture. (Tie-dye colors, bong water, and that funky smell coming from your older brother’s van.) But this stellar B2B landing page takes modernized and, dare we say, adult approach to wholesale hemp oil extracts. From its clean design to persuasive copy, it makes a strong case that this is an industry that demands to be taken seriously.

### Targeting Professionals Who Already Know

Unlike B2C landing pages, this page speaks to a professional crowd. By which I mean, people who know what it means when plant extract contains “natural terpenes” and has been “decarboxylated.” We might suggest going with a more impactful headline, but wholesalers are likely very aware of the benefits. Cutting to the chase can’t be a bad thing.

### 35\. Border Buddy

The headline starts with the pain and insecurity (“Importing and Exporting Is Hard”) that any visitor who hits this landing page from a PPC campaign is likely to be feeling. Crucially, though, the promise of a solution appears with equal clarity above the fold: “We do the hard part for you,” says Border Buddy. Perfect.

#### Cut Through Customs Complexity

Bringing your purchases across the border can get very messy, so keeping this landing page clean is essential. There’s no more information here than what you need to know. No legalese either. You’ll have a customs broker worrying about all those small details for you.

### 36\. REI Co Op

#### Engaging Call-to-Actions on REI Coop's Landing Page

- Carousel of messages
- Repeated "shop now" prompts
- Encouragement to "save 40%"

They can shop now or get a $25 gift card for shopping now. The site has a link to the nearest brick-and-mortar store and links to 10 kinds of merchandise. Still, all of the featured links on the page lead to immediate shopping.

### 37\. Wix

## How To Arrive At A Creative Landing Page Design In 8 Steps

![Creative Landing Page Design](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/ukaq82u0bj9.jpg)

### 1\. Set your campaign goal

Setting a campaign goal is pivotal to the success of your landing page. Your goal could be to:

- Increase sales
- Generate leads
- Boost conversions

It's crucial to set a realistic and measurable goal that aligns with your business objectives.

### 2: Select a Landing Page Template

Choosing a [pre-made landing page](https://zapier.com/blog/best-landing-page-builders/) template can save you time and effort. MagicUI Pro offers a range of templates to choose from, allowing you to customize the design and content to meet your specific goals. These templates provide a solid foundation for your landing page, making it easier to focus on customization.

### 3: Write your copy

Crafting compelling copy is essential for engaging visitors and driving conversions. Your headline should be attention-grabbing and clear, highlighting the key benefits of your offering. Focus on how your product or service can solve the visitor's problems and keep your copy concise and easy to read.

### 4: Craft your CTA

[Your Call to Action (CTA](https://nuancedmedia.com/why-your-website-needs-calls-to-action/)) is the key element that prompts visitors to take action. Ensure your CTA is clear, specific, and compelling. Avoid generic CTAs like "Learn More" and opt for descriptive options like "Start Your Free Trial" or "Book A Demo" for better results.

### 5: Select your images

Visual elements play a crucial role in capturing visitors' attention. Choose high-quality images that resonate with your target audience. Start with a hero image that showcases your offer and include visuals that highlight the benefits of your product or service.

### 6: Connect your landing page

Integrating your landing page with your business domain and analytics tools is essential for tracking performance. Customize your URL, add tracking scripts like Google Analytics, and ensure seamless integration with your marketing stack for a complete setup.

### 7: Preview and publish

Before launching your landing page, review the copy, SEO settings, and form functionality. Ensure there are no typos, optimize for search engines, and test all forms to confirm they work as intended before publishing your page.

### 8: Optimize Your Landing Page

Once your landing page is live, continue to optimize its performance through A/B testing. Test different elements such as headlines, visuals, and CTAs to maximize conversions. Regular testing and optimization will help you achieve the best results from your landing page.

## Best Practices For Creating A Landing Page

![Creative Landing Page Design](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/kbunhnu1qjs.jpg)

The first thing you need to remember when creating a landing page is that it needs to be very specific. This is essential for a number of reasons, but the primary one is that it helps significantly [increase your conversion rates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davelavinsky/2014/03/18/how-to-increase-conversion-rates/). Why? because those who visit your landing page are looking for something specific.

They have clicked on an ad or followed a link because they want something. It might be a special offer, some information about a product or service, or a free report or webinar. If your landing page doesn't offer them what they are looking for, they'll just hit the back button. Having a single, fixed goal allows you to get better conversion rates. So don’t send out multiple, mixed messages. Instead, stick to a single CTA—both in your ad and your landing page form.

### Choose a Relevant Hero Image

When choosing a hero image, you need to think of your target audience and identify the kind of image appeals to them. For example:

- Are they young and looking for the latest tech gadgets?
- Are they business professionals looking for the most efficient way to get things done?
- Are they stay-at-home moms looking to have more fun with their families?

Then, pick a photo that not only appeals to visitors but also reinforces your message or value proposition. Now, place it in a spot that leads to your CTA, which is where you want your visitors to look next.

Here are some images that will make for a successful landing page:

- Simple images that evoke emotion
- Images that feature people
- A straightforward color palette that matches your landing page

### Treat your CTA with Utmost Care

The CTA is, without a doubt, the most important part of your landing page. If your CTA isn’t convincing enough, your visitors won’t convert. Studying effective CTAs is the best way to know which ones could work for your specific purpose.

Some characteristics of effective landing page CTAs are:

- Focused on the benefit
- Straight to the point (five words at most)
- Action verbs (get, download, click, register, etc.)

Apart from great button copy, you also have to highlight your CTA. Here are a few more ways to make your CTA stand out on your landing page:

- Surround your CTA button with negative space, so it won’t compete for attention
- Look at your page the way your visitor will, follow where their eyes go, and place the CTA there
- Test everything–your button shape, size, color, font, and copy

### Do A/B testing

An A/B test, also called split testing, is creating two slightly different variations of a single page to see which one works better. The key thing to note here is the slight variation as you conduct the test by changing one small element at a time.

Examples of A/B testing include testing between a red and green CTA button, two different headlines, or two hero images. You can’t just do A/B Testing at random, so to decide which variable to test, follow the [ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) framework](https://blog.growthhackers.com/the-practical-advantage-of-the-ice-score-as-a-test-prioritization-framework-cdd5f0808d64).

## Common Mistakes To Avoid While Designing A Creative Landing Page

![Creative Landing Page Design](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/z3mltgy5ufk.jpg)

### No Images or Low-Quality Graphics

Using high-quality images and videos on your landing page is crucial since people process visual content much faster than text. Using generic, pixelated, or outdated images can harm the [credibility of your page](https://codenest.co/knowledge-center/how-to-improve-website-credibility/#:~:text=Credibility%20is%20a%20term%20that,enough%20to%20deliver%20its%20promises.). Stock photography can make your page look less authentic and reduce trustworthiness.

### Page Layouts with Too Much Content and Complexity

While creativity is essential, avoid overwhelming your visitors with complex page layouts and too much content. Unclear messaging and elements like auto-playing videos with sound can discourage visitors. Make sure your page is mobile responsive and loads quickly for a better user experience.

### Unscannable Copy

Good copy is key to creating clear and intuitive landing page experiences. It should be:

- Well-written
- Suggestive
- Exciting

Avoid using too much text, grammatical errors, long blocks of text, or a dull tone. Visitors will trust you more if they feel the copy is tailored to them and tells a compelling story.
