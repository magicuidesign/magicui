# **What Is React?**

![React Tips](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/b0z94xv7mv9.jpg?w=3840&q=75)

React.Js is an open-source Javascript library developed by Meta for creating user interfaces (UIs). It helps create reusable UI components and uses virtual DOM to improve app performance. It can be used on both client and server sides and is easily integrated with other front-end frameworks. Its component-based approach, reusability, developer tools, and performance optimization make it a great choice for developers.

One of React's famous applications is Instagram. Features like geolocations, Google Maps APIs, and tags that pop up without hashtags are all impressive implementations of React. Even the makers of React, Facebook, use React for their webpage, and the mobile version is made using one of its famous frameworks, [**React native**](https://react.dev/).

# **Benefits Of Using React**

_React Tips_

## **Improved User Experience**

React allows developers to build highly interactive and responsive user interfaces, resulting in a smoother and more engaging user experience. The virtual DOM efficiently updates and renders only the changed components, reducing load times and improving performance.

## **Reusable Components**

React promotes a modular approach with reusable components, self-contained modules that can be used across different parts of an application. Reusable components save development time, improve maintainability, and make adding new features or fixing bugs easier.

## **Efficient Development Process**

React provides a rich set of tools and libraries that facilitate the development process, such as React Developer Tools, Redux, and React Router. Its simple and intuitive syntax makes it easy to learn and use, especially for developers familiar with JavaScript.

## **Performance Optimization**

React utilizes a virtual DOM and a diffing algorithm to efficiently update and render only the necessary parts of the UI, resulting in faster rendering and improved overall performance.

## **Flexibility and Integration**

React seamlessly integrates with other technologies and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for web development. It can be used with popular libraries like Axios for [**API requests or UI frameworks**](https://hackernoon.com/why-is-react-the-best-front-end-framework-to-learn-in-2024) like Bootstrap for styling components.

# **15 Best React Tips And Hacks For Enhanced Code Readability & Performance**

![React Tips](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/hz68wjs8djp.jpg?w=3840&q=75)

## **1\. Use React Fragments**

React fragments allow you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This can be useful when you need to render a list of items without adding extra markup. Use fragments all the time to tidy up the DOM and improve readability.

Below is a simple example of using a react fragment in a functional React component:

`const MyComponent = () => { return ( <React.Fragment> <h1>My React Component</h1> <p>This is an example of using React Fragment in a functional component.</p> </React.Fragment> ); };`Copy

In this example, the react fragment is used to contain a heading and a paragraph without having to add any extra HTML elements.

## **2\. Use Constants**

In JavaScript we can declare constants by using the const keyword. This helps us avoid re-declaring the same value. So constants are a great choice for storing API keys and other values like that. Constants improve the scalability, readability, and internationalization of any React codebase. In every ReactJS project, you should avoid hard-coding strings (content) in your components.

This will make your project more maintainable, scalable, and readable, as it isolates the UI, data, and content layers from each other. Constants include:

- API key
- URLs
- Content

Many websites support multiple languages, like English, French, Spanish, and so on. This is known as internationalization (or i18n for short). If you're enabling i18n features on your site, you should create separate constant files for your content – for example en.js and fr.js. Even if you don't have multiple language support or no i18n, keeping your content outside your code in a constant file is still a good idea.

You can either name your constant file\[LANGUAGE_INITIAL\].js, or constants.js. These are the most common file names developers use for this purpose.

## **3\. Use React With TypeScript**

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that can help you catch errors early and make your code more maintainable. It also makes it easier to refactor code. It is one hot skill that has been trending in the frontend space recently and one of the developers’ top choices for learning shortly.

Learning Typescript is a game-changer with profound productivity effects for your React applications. The create-react app now comes with built-in support for typescript.

To start a new Create React App project with TypeScript, you can run:

npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

or

yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript

The advantages of using typescript with React include type safety, faster development time, future-proof code, improved code readability, and improved scalability. Below is a simple example of using TypeScript in a functional React component:

`import * as React from 'react'; interface Props { text: string; } const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ text }) => { return ( <div> {text} </div> ); };`

## **4\. Separate Presentational & Container Components**

Separating Presentational and container Components makes our code easier to test and reason about. Presentational components are concerned with how things look. They receive their data and behavior from parent components. Container components are concerned with how things work. They provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.

This approach allows us to reuse the same presentational components with different data and behavior. It also makes our code cleaner and much easier to test.

## **5\. Separate Presentational & Container Components**

Separating Presentational and container Components makes our code easier to test and reason about. Presentational components are concerned with how things look. They receive their data and behavior from parent components. Container components are concerned with how things work. They provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components.

This approach allows us to reuse the same presentational components with different data and behavior. It also makes our code cleaner and much easier to test.

## **6\. Don’t Forget to Remove the Listener When Unmounting Components!**

Event listeners, such as Keyboard Listeners, Event Listeners, etc, are important methods in React. When you add listeners on useEffect like onMouseOver, onScroll, onClick, etc., it will create listeners for you, but not everyone knows how important it is to remove it.

Otherwise, when you back to the component, it will create another listener object which contributes to memory leaks and unexpected listeners behavior.

So the best solution is to remove listeners, freeing out memory and providing you with uninterrupted behavior.
