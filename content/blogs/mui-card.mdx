Material UI is a React-based UI framework designed to create consistent user interfaces across web and mobile applications. It includes many components and tools to help developers easily create modern user interfaces.

It's a one-stop solution for developers, providing a comprehensive library of components and tools to create modern user interfaces easily. From input to layout components, it has everything you need. The Material [UI card](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/) is an example of the Material UI surfaces.

## What Is Material UI Card?

Cards contain information and actions about a single topic. Material UI cards are an excellent way to add a visually appealing, well-organized layout to a website quickly. They are simple to use and can be customized with various options, such as:

- Colors
- Sizes
- Images

To make a card, simply choose the card component from the Material UI library and customize it to your specifications. You can also quickly add content to the card, such as text, images, and buttons. Material UI cards are an excellent way to quickly improve the visual appeal and organization of a website.

### Balancing Functionality with Concise Information Presentation

Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use caution and remember that cards are gateways to more complex and detailed information. They should be simple to scan for relevant and actionable data. Text and images, for example, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

## What Is The Difference Between Card And Paper In Material UI?

![MUI Card](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581934952711-2fc9c6521e7b?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxkaXNjdXNzfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMDIyNDM1MHww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Material UI, a component library in React, has many components. Paper is a component that works similarly to a card. They can be mistaken for each other, but below are the differences between them.

### Card

- Named after physical cards
- Extends the Paper component
- Used with its child components (e.g CardActions, CardMedia, etc)
- Has a set shadow or elevation

### Paper

- Named after physical sheets of paper
- Doesn't extend any component; instead serves as a base for the Card component.
- Doesn't have any specific child components
- Doesn't have a set shadow or elevation

In other words, Paper is the base from which the Card component is built. This also shows that Papers are more dynamic than Cards.

## What Are The Components Of Material UI Card?

![MUI Card](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507925921958-8a62f3d1a50d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxub3Rlc3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjAyMjQzMjd8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Material UI card is made up of a list of components such as:

- CardActionArea
- CardActions
- CardContent
- CardHeader
- CardMedia

### CardActionArea

The CardActionArea component in Material UI makes an area within a card clickable by wrapping contents within a card that should be interactive. The code snippet below shows how to use CardActionArea in combination with a Card component:

```jsx
import { CardActionArea } from "@mui/material";
import Card from "@mui/material/Card";
<Card>
  <CardActionArea>{/* Card Contents */}</CardActionArea>
</Card>;
```

### CardHeader

The Material UI CardHeader provides context to a card by adding a header. It can display a title, an avatar, a subheader, and an action within a card. The example code below shows how to use a CardHeader component.

```jsx
import { CardHeader, Avatar, IconButton } from "@mui/material";
import Card from "@mui/material/Card";
<Card>
  <CardHeader
    avatar={<Avatar aria-label="card-name">C</Avatar>}
    title="Card Title"
    subheader="Subheader"
    action={<IconButton aria-label="settings"></IconButton>}
  />
</Card>;
```

### CardMedia

The CardMedia component in Material UI allows adding images, videos, icons, and other media within a card. Below is the example code for using a CardMedia component:

```jsx
<Card>
  <CardMedia
    style={{ paddingTop: "24px" }}
    image="./background.png"
    title="Background image"
  />
</Card>
```

### CardContent

The CardContent component is used to wrap the core contents of the Card component. The code snippet below illustrates how to use the CardContent component:

```jsx
import { CardContent } from "@mui/material";
import Card from "@mui/material/Card";
<Card>
  <CardContent>{/* Card Contents */}</CardContent>
</Card>;
```

### CardActions

In material UI, the CardActions component is used to add card actions. The code snippet below shows how to use CardActions in combination with a Card component:

```jsx
import { CardActions, Button } from "@mui/material";
import Card from "@mui/material/Card";
<Card>
  <CardActions>
    <Button>Click here</Button>
  </CardActions>
</Card>;
```

```jsx
import {
  Card,
  CardActions,
  CardContent,
  Button,
  Typography,
} from "@mui/material";
import "./styles.css";

const BasicCard = () => {
  return (
    <Card sx={{ maxWidth: 400 }}>
      <CardContent>
        <Typography
          sx={{ fontSize: 24, mb: 2, textAlign: "center" }}
          variant="h2"
          color="text.secondary"
          gutterBottom
        >
          Insightful Design Tip
        </Typography>
        <Typography
          sx={{ fontSize: 18, mb: 1.5 }}
          variant="h5"
          color="text.secondary"
        >
          "MagicUI is a free and open-source UI library that we designed
          specifically for design engineers."
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 1 }} variant="body2">
          "Best UI Library" by MagicUI.
        </Typography>
      </CardContent>
      <CardActions>
        <Button size="small">Read More</Button>
      </CardActions>
    </Card>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Basic card</h1>
      <BasicCard />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

You can create your own Material UI card component by following these steps and using the provided code snippet. The framework offers a straightforward way to structure and style information, making it visually appealing and structured for your webpage or application.

The image card is a more interactive card type. It allows developers to include an image or icon, as well as a title and description, making it easier to convey a message to the user in a timely and effective manner.

This results in a more fluid, intuitive user experience, as the user can quickly access and interact with the data without having to scroll or search for it. This feature also displays a visual representation of the data to the user, making it easier to digest and comprehend the information.
