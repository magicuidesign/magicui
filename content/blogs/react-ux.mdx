React Native is an open-source framework that provides developers with resources such as pre-built components, libraries, and reference material. This framework is the basic structure upon which applications are developed and allows customization to suit individual needs. It eliminates the need to build applications from scratch, making the development process more efficient and less time-consuming.

### What Does "Native" Mean in React Native?

When an application or software is considered native, it means that it is specifically written for a device's natural operating system. For instance, a PlayStation 5 game is native to the PS5 because it was designed exclusively for that particular device and operating system.

- Native applications and code usually provide a better user experience as they are optimized to perform efficiently and seamlessly on their designated platforms.
- React Native enables developers to render applications natively, ensuring that the applications run smoothly and perform exceptionally despite not being tailored specifically for a particular device or OS.

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a powerful tool for developers that allows for the efficient development of applications with native functionality. By leveraging this framework, developers can create applications that run smoothly and perform optimally on various platforms.
