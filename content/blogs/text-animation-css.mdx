Consider you’re scrolling through a website, intrigued by its content, when suddenly, you’re hit with a wall of text. What’s the first thing you do?

One of the best ways to avoid this scenario is to use CSS text animation. You can create a more visually appealing website with text animations that grab users' attention and improve their overall experience. Learning text animation CSS is a [web design best practice](https://magicui.design/blog/web-design-best-practices) that will help you create appealing websites that engage visitors and enhance their experience. In this article, we’ll share the top 15 text animations on CSS to help you get started.

Text animations are a dynamic and engaging [web design element](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-web-design-definition-elements.html#:~:text=The%20elements%20of%20web%20design,layout%2C%20content%2C%20and%20navigation.) that can transform your website from static to captivating. Adding movement and visual interest to your text can enhance user experience, boost engagement, and leave a lasting impression.

### The Impact of Text Animations 

#### Increased User Engagement

Studies have shown that websites with animations can significantly improve user engagement and time spent on the page. For example, a study by Adobe found that websites with animated elements saw a [39% increase in user engagement](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-creating-engaging-user-interfaces-with-animation#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20a%20report%20by%20Adobe%20found%20that%2039%25%20of%20users%20are%20more%20likely%20to%20share%20content%20if%20it%20contains%20animations.) compared to those without.

#### Improved Conversion Rates

[Animated text](https://levitatemedia.com/learn/text-animation#:~:text=Text%20animation%2C%20as%20the%20name,certain%20area%20on%20the%20screen.) can enhance the overall user experience, leading to higher conversion rates. Users who are more engaged and enjoy their time on a website are likelier to take desired actions, such as purchasing or signing up for a newsletter.

#### Enhanced Brand Recall

Unique and memorable text animations can help your brand stand out and be remembered. When users associate your brand with visually appealing and engaging animations, they are more likely to recall your brand when making purchasing decisions.

## How Text Animations Work (A Step-by-Step Guide)

![Text Animation CSS](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/1ahixlv1uqih.jpg)

Text animations are created using CSS properties that define how text elements should move, change appearance, or interact with other elements on a web page. The two primary properties involved are animation and keyframes.

### The Animation Property: Mastering the Basics

[The animation property](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-animation-property/#:~:text=The%20CSS%20animation%20property%20is,%2Dtiming%2Dfunction%20animation%2Ddelay) is a shorthand property that combines several individual animation properties into a single declaration. It allows you to control various aspects of an animation, such as:

#### Animation-name

Specifies the name of the keyframe animation sequence to use.

#### Animation-duration

Sets the duration of the animation in seconds or milliseconds.

#### Animation-timing-function

Defines the speed curve of the animation (e.g., linear, ease-in-out).

#### Animation-delay

Specifies the delay before the animation starts.

#### Animation-iteration-count

Determines the number of times the animation should repeat.

#### Animation-direction

Sets the direction the animation plays (e.g., standard, reverse).

#### Animation-fill-mode

Controls the style of the element before and after the animation.

### The Keyframes Rule: Defining the Stages of Animation

[The keyframes rule](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.php#:~:text=The%20%40keyframes%20rule%20specifies%20the,of%20CSS%20styles%20many%20times.) is used to define the different stages of an animation. Each keyframe represents a specific point in time within the animation, and its properties determine the element's appearance at that point. Keyframes are typically defined using percentages (e.g., 0%, 50%, 100%) to indicate their position within the animation sequence.

#### Understanding Keyframes in a Text Animation

Keyframes allow you to precisely control the appearance of an element at different points in time. You can create complex and visually appealing animations by setting properties like opacity, transform, color, and font size for each keyframe.

#### Keyframe Animation Sequence

- Initial State: The first keyframe (usually 0%) defines the element's initial appearance. This is the starting point from which the animation begins.
- Intermediate States: Additional keyframes can be added to define the element's appearance at various points throughout the animation. These keyframes can be used to create smooth transitions between different states.
- Final State: The final keyframe (usually 100%) defines the desired appearance of the element at the end of the animation. This is the target state that the animation aims to achieve.

#### Animating Multiple Properties Within a Single Sequence

You can animate multiple properties within a single keyframe sequence. This allows you to create complex animations that involve changes in various aspects of an element's appearance. For example, you could animate a text element's opacity and transform properties to create a fading and rotating effect.

### A More Advanced Example: Combining Multiple Animations and Keyframes

Here's a more advanced example that combines multiple animations and keyframes:

#### HTML

```html
<h1 id="animated-text">Animated Text</h1>
```

Use code with caution.

#### CSS

```css
#animated-text {
  animation: fadeInRotate 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

```css
@keyframes fadeInRotate {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: rotate(180deg);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1; 
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

In this example, the text element fades in and rotates continuously. The fadeInRotate animation has three keyframes:

- 0%: The text starts invisible and rotates 0 degrees.

- 50%: The text becomes visible and rotates 180 degrees.

- 100%: The text remains visible and rotates 360 degrees.

By understanding the animation property, the keyframe rule, and the concept of keyframe sequences, you can create a wide range of dynamic and engaging text animations for your web projects.
