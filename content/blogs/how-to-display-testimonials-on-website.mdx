## What Are Testimonials And Why Are They Crucial?

![How To Display Testimonials On Website](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/iz6wd2ma7w.jpg)

A [testimonial](https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/customer-testimonials/) is, at its core, a customer review. The customer attests to using your product and, in their own words, tells the vast audience of the internet what their experience was like.

- While you can get testimonials from celebrities and other influencers, the testimonials of regular people, just like your potential customers, carry the most weight.
- Their experiences are relatable and trustworthy, instilling in your audience a sense of security and confidence.
- When you add customer testimonials and reviews to your website, your customers help you tell your story, market your products, and stand out.

Displaying testimonials on your website is a strategic move that offers several key benefits:

### Builds Trust and Credibility

Testimonials provide social proof, demonstrating that other people have had positive experiences with your company. This boosts your credibility and reassures potential customers about the reliability of your products or services.

#### Powerful Impact

[Statistics underscore this impact](https://boast.io/20-statistics-about-using-testimonials-in-marketing/), where 92% of consumers read online reviews before buying, and 72% say positive testimonials and reviews increase their trust in a business.

### Explains Specific Aspects of Your Products or Services

Testimonials can address common questions or concerns about your offerings, giving potential customers detailed insights without a hard sell.

This can be especially effective if the testimonials highlight unique features or benefits that may take time to be noticeable.

### Tells Your Company’s Story

Personal stories and experiences shared through testimonials help potential customers connect emotionally with your brand.

This connection can be a powerful motivator, as people often make purchasing decisions based on their feelings about a brand.

### Addresses Common Questions

By having your customers address frequently asked questions or specific concerns, testimonials can provide answers and solutions that resonate with new visitors. This approach informs and builds confidence in your ability to meet their needs. Testimonials are more than just praise—they are a strategic tool for:

- Building trust
- Explaining your value
- Connecting with your audience on a deeper level

### Video Testimonial Page

A dedicated video testimonial page adds depth to your testimonials by capturing customer emotions and body language.

## 6 Effective Tips For Gathering Client Testimonials

![How To Display Testimonials On Website](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1649252504308-af4a8477cd2a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxpZGVhdGlvbnxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjI4OTc1MzF8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Reach Out via Email to Satisfied Customers

One of the best ways to gather client testimonials is to email satisfied customers. These customers have previously expressed positive feedback about your business through meetings or calls.

By sending a personalized email requesting a testimonial, you can make them feel appreciated and more likely to contribute. This approach reinforces their importance to your business and shows that you value their feedback.

### 2\. Check Social Media Pages and Review Sites

Another strategy for collecting testimonials is to review customer comments on your social media pages and monitor mentions of your business using social listening tools.

#### Review Platforms

For more feedback, explore review sites like:

- Google Maps
- Yelp
- TripAdvisor
- Trustpilot

#### Legal Review Use

Instead of directly copying reviews, display them using widgets or seek permission to feature unique testimonials to [avoid copyright issues](https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/).

### 3\. Use Pre-Existing Testimonials for Individual Team Members

If your business is newer and has limited client feedback, consider leveraging testimonials for individual team members or employees.  A testimonial about a specific team member's work can serve as a valuable endorsement and help build credibility for your business.

### 4\. Pay a Previous Customer, Celebrity, or Influencer for an Endorsement

While not a strategy that will work for every business, paying a previous customer, celebrity, or influencer to provide a testimonial can significantly boost. To maintain authenticity, it's essential to ensure transparency by clearly stating any compensation or incentives associated with the testimonial.

### 5\. Integrate Testimonial Requests into the Service Process

Another effective way to gather testimonials is to integrate feedback requests into your service process or follow-up communications.

This can be done through automated emails or surveys after service completion, making it easier for customers to provide testimonials and share their experiences with your business.

### 6\. Prioritize Authenticity and Uniqueness

When collecting testimonials, it's crucial to prioritize authenticity and uniqueness. Avoid fabricating testimonials, as consumers can usually spot fake reviews.

Focus on collecting unique and genuine testimonials that address common pain points or concerns. Highlight how your business resolves issues or improves experiences to demonstrate your commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.

### 1\. Be Concise

When presenting testimonials, displaying only the most impactful parts of each testimonial is crucial.

#### Author Approval

Lengthy quotes should be trimmed to their essence while ensuring the original author's approval before publication.

#### Engaging

This approach keeps the content engaging and to the point, giving visitors a quick and compelling overview of the positive feedback your product or service has received.

### 2\. Use a Clear, Readable Font Size

### 3\. Embrace Negative Space

Creating an uncluttered design with ample white space around each testimonial improves readability and visual appeal.

Overcrowding the page could confuse and make it challenging for readers to focus on the testimonials. Opting for a clean, straightforward design keeps each testimonial prominent and easy to digest.

### 4\. Refine Grammar and Preserve the Essence

Correcting any typos or spelling mistakes in testimonials is essential while maintaining the original voice and message of the testimonial.

#### Trustworthy Testimonials

This balance between professionalism and authenticity can significantly impact the trustworthiness of testimonials.

#### Author Consent

Always seek the author's approval on the edited content to ensure their satisfaction with the final testimonial.

### 5\. Share Reviewer Details as Appropriate

For B2B platforms, credibility can be enhanced by including full names, job titles, and company logos.

#### Testimonial Verification

Providing full names and photos (with consent) on consumer sites can authenticate the testimonial. In sensitive sectors like healthcare, using partial names or allowing for complete anonymity can help maintain privacy and confidentiality.

### 6\. Personalize with Signatures or Handwriting Fonts

Adding a personalized touch, such as authentic signatures or [handwriting fonts](https://fontmeme.com/handwriting-fonts/), can enhance the authenticity of testimonials. It's essential to have permission before using real signatures or fonts that resemble a customer's handwriting.

This personalization can make testimonials feel more genuine and relatable to website visitors, increasing their trust in the reviews and testimonials displayed.
