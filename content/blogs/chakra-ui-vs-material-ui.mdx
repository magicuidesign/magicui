### Material UI vs Chakra UI: A Deep Dive

When comparing [Material UI and Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/comparison), one core concept to consider is the ease of modification. Material UI adds many classes to individual HTML tags while providing a breadth of pre-styled UI components. This can make it cumbersome for developers to customize their interface, as they often have to fight against base styles when applying custom styles. On the other hand, Chakra UI allows more freedom in manipulating CSS classes of exported components and layouts, often requiring less code to achieve the desired styling.

### Responsive Styling: Material UI vs Chakra UI

Regarding responsive styling, Material UI necessitates the creation of separate codes to control responsive styling based on viewport changes. Conversely, Chakra UI offers built-in support for responsive styling, eliminating the need for additional CSS classes or media queries. This feature can be particularly beneficial when building applications that need to be responsive across various devices and screen sizes.

### Scalability and Custom Design: Material UI vs Chakra UI

If custom styling is not a major concern for your project, Material UI can be beneficial as it provides a wide array of pre-styled components that can be easily integrated. However, when scalability and custom designs are crucial, Chakra UI shines. Its layout-focused approach allows for creating flexible, composable, and scalable code, which is essential as projects grow over time.

## Chakra UI Vs Material UI: Detailed Analysis

![Chakra UI Vs Material U](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517817748493-49ec54a32465?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxMHx8bm90ZXN8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzE5MDYyMTc1fDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Ease of Use

The developer experience is a critical factor in selecting a UI library. Chakra UI excels in providing an intuitive learning and usability experience. It facilitates rapid development through intuitive and reusable components, adherence to principles of simplicity, and flexibility. It streamlines intricate tasks, such as responsive styling based on viewport changes, and simplified manual manipulation of CSS classes for customization.

On the other hand, Material UI, with its extensive feature set, presents a steeper learning curve. This could be more challenging for developers new to the library or those less experienced in Google’s Material Design principles. However, it’s worth noting that both Chakra UI and Material UI have thorough and user-friendly documentation, which includes clear examples and explanations, providing a strong support system for effective library utilization.

### Customization

Material UI lets you change its look through themes, but changing its default styles can get tricky. In contrast, Chakra UI was designed with easy customization, empowering you to change your design easily without messing too much with overriding styles. Chakra UI keeps its class names simple and clean, further enhancing the ease of customization.

Chakra UI makes it easier to tweak CSS classes, while Material UI doesn’t make this as straightforward. Material UI has many components ready to go, but it’s not as easy to change their styles.

### Ease of Modification

The Chakra UI has a clean class name structure. Now, what does that mean? For example, if you see the HTML source code built in both libraries, you will see the material UI adds so many classes to each HTML tag created for the material component, whereas Chakra UI adds comparatively fewer classes. Also, Chakra UI provides easy manual manipulation in CSS classes, whereas Material UI has way more options for many components than Chakra UI. In addition, Material UI components have more features and properties, which make them more flexible.

### Performance

Chakra UI uses CSS-in-JS, offering customization at a slight performance cost. This is due to runtime style computations and className generation, which might be noticeable in performance-sensitive, large apps. However, Chakra UI is an excellent option for small to medium applications.

Conversely, Material UI showed impressive performance in real-world tests. A significant reduction in blocking time, a slight drop in memory usage, and a notable decrease in CPU usage were observed, contributing to a smoother and faster user experience. Material UI leads in efficiency, making it suitable for sites requiring robust performance, while Chakra UI performs well for small to medium-sized sites.

### Working with Other Frameworks

Both libraries share compatibility with various JavaScript frameworks. Chakra UI integrates well with Theme UI, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI. It also supports integration with frameworks such as:

- React Bootstrap
- Semantic UI React
- Ant Design
- Blueprint

On the flip side, Material UI demonstrates compatibility with Node.js for server-side rendering. However, while integrating Chakra UI with other frameworks is generally seamless, certain limitations may apply. For instance, some advanced components, such as a carousel or date picker, may not be included, requiring the use of other frameworks for these components.

### Extensions and Plugins

The [functionality of UI libraries](https://npmtrends.com/@chakra-ui/react-vs-material-ui) is significantly enhanced by extensions and plugins. Chakra UI offers a range of additional features, including:

- A Figma plugin for converting designs to Chakra UI code
- A Visual Studio Code extension for documentation access
- Community-created plugins like Chakra UI Prose for styled HTML content and Supa Palette Plugin for color palette generation.

Material UI also offers a range of plugins, including individual HTML tags related to:

- Third-party tools
- UI kits for design tools
- Code snippet libraries
- Additional UI components

Through its extensive plugin ecosystem, these plugins enhance the library’s features, add reusability, and introduce new features to the components.

### Community and Support

Material UI enjoys a large, active community, offering abundant resources, tutorials, and support facilitated by its widespread adoption. Chakra UI, though smaller, has a rapidly growing community known for its supportive environment. Its clear and concise documentation is accessible to newcomers, with the community expected to expand further.

Material UI has a larger community, but the Chakra UI community is also growing and welcoming. In terms of NMP downloads, Chakra currently surpasses Material UI downloads.

### Steep Learning Curve

Material UI and Chakra UI come with extensive feature sets, which can make the learning curve quite steep for some users. However, the vast array of components can be both a blessing and a curse. Each library has its unique approach to component styling and customization, requiring users to learn their respective systems. As a result, developers need to invest time into understanding the ins and outs of the library to make the most out of it. This complexity can be both a challenge and a barrier for beginners looking to start quickly.

### Compatibility Issues

Compatibility issues can arise when integrating third-party libraries or plugins into projects built with either Chakra UI or Material UI. These issues can be time-consuming to troubleshoot and resolve. A plug-and-play experience can become a frustrating debugging exercise when styles begin to clash—consequently, the more extensive the feature set, the higher the chances of encountering compatibility issues. Users should consider the possibility of compatibility issues when exploring the use of third-party tools or plugins with these frameworks.

### Keeping Up with Updates

Material UI and Chakra UI are actively maintained frameworks, so regular updates are released. Developers must keep abreast of the updates to ensure their projects remain up-to-date. Updates may introduce breaking changes, forcing developers to modify their codebase to remain compatible with the latest version of the library. While updates are crucial to ensuring the security and efficiency of the framework, developers should be prepared to invest time in updating their libraries.

### Performance Concerns

Both libraries offer powerful tools for building user interfaces but have additional dependencies that can impact bundle size. Though versatile, these libraries can lead to slow loading times and degraded performance if not managed correctly.

## Which One Should You Choose?

![Chakra UI Vs Material U](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581934932994-e4ac37c0c882?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxkaXNjdXNzfGVufDB8fHx8MTcxOTA2MDMxOXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Material UI is a better UI framework if the design itself doesn’t need to be highly customized and is not the center of the product you’re building, and as long as you’re okay with your platform looking “Material UI-ish” and not unique. That’s because it comes with many pre-designed components that are not highly customizable.

### High Customization vs. Predefined Styles

Chakra UI is the way to go if many components need to be designed individually and highly customizable. Chakra UI is the way to go if many components need to be designed individually and highly customizable. The reason is that this design framework is less “opinionated.” It has fewer predefined style components, so it’s easier to style it according to your own design guidelines.

### Material UI's Edge for Large-Scale Applications

Material UI is much better when it comes to performance and reliability. Chakra UI is not bad in performance but can lag a bit on data-heavy, large-enterprise websites.

### A Project-Centric Approach to Selecting a UI Framework

Choosing Chakra UI and Material UI depends on your project's specific needs. Consider factors such as the size of the project, the need for customization, the learning curve, and the performance implications when making your choice. The best tool is the one that best fits your needs.
