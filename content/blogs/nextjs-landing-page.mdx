## What Is Nextjs?

Next.js is a powerful and flexible React framework for building modern web applications. It is built on top of Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to [run JavaScript code on the server side](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/56509/Can-we-execute-server-side-code-using-JavaScript).

### A Fusion of React and Server-Side Rendering

Next.js combines the best features of React, a popular JavaScript library for:

- Building user interfaces
- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- Other advanced features.

### Addressing the Limitations of Traditional React Apps

Next.js was created by the private company Vercel to address issues with traditional React apps. React apps can only be rendered in users’ browsers. However, that can be problematic if the client is disabled from JavaScript or has a lot of information to render. Next.js extends the functions of React by rendering pages and apps on the server side, making the process fast and efficient.

### The Team Behind Next.js

React becomes a viable option as a framework for creating a mobile app with the power of Next.js. The framework author, Guillermo Rauch, serves as the CEO of Vercel, and Tim Neutkens is the project’s lead maintainer.

### A Versatile Framework for Modern Web Development

Next.js is a versatile and efficient tool for developers creating modern [web applications with enhanced performance](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-build-scalable-high-performance-web-applications-lucy-kristena) and scalability. Its combination of React and server-side rendering capabilities makes it a valuable framework for building dynamic and robust web solutions. With Next.js, developers can leverage React and server-side rendering strengths to create high-performing, scalable, and efficient web applications.

### Ease of Use

Next.js provides a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to get started building web applications. It also offers built-in support for CSS and SASS, allowing developers to style their applications easily.

### Performance

With server-side rendering and [static site generation features](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/differences-static-generated-sites-server-side-rendered-apps/), Next.js enables fast initial page loads and optimal performance. It automatically optimizes and bundles the application for efficient delivery to the client.

### Fast Loading

Next.js’ in-built image optimization capabilities ensure that these websites enjoy lightning-fast page loads, higher conversion rates, and reduced bounce rates. According to WebAlmanac, images contribute to 75 percent of a webpage’s weight. This is where Next.js comes in. Its custom image component automatically optimizes images—no matter the number—to ensure the best performance.

### SEO-Friendly

Next.js generates [static files written in HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_website_static.asp), which are easily crawlable by search engines. This improves search engine optimization (SEO) and helps your website rank higher in search results.

## Key Components Of A Successful Nextjs Landing Page

![](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/8c6igalgv2o.jpg)

### Header

A header is the central part of the top section of your website that helps to introduce your graphic charter and branding. Usually, you’ll find it on all the pages of your website. The word Header contains the root word Head. And just like a human’s head, a header, in web design, is the website’s head. It’s where we go to find the navigation system of the website, which contains all the main links we need to browse your website.

### Navbar

A navbar is the navigation bar in the user interface that contains all the main links to other sections or pages of the website. In the navbar, you can find the product’s logo, links, and a call-to-action button.

### Hero Section

The hero section is typically the first thing visitors see when they land on your webpage. It usually includes an image or video that expresses the website's main message and a description that can be a slogan, a product description, some small text for details, or a call to action.

### Features/Benefits Section

As one can guess, the features section describes the technical features of the product being sold. This section also shows how valuable the product is and what the benefits of using it are. Based on the company’s marketing strategy, this part demonstrates how different and superior their product is from their competitors.

### Testimonials Section

The [testimonials section](https://www.peppercontent.io/blog/benefits-of-customer-testimonials/) is where you can put your customers’ previous reviews and comments about how good your products or services are. It’s a great strategy companies use to build trust, demonstrate social proof, and convince/attract new customers.

### Footer

A [landing page footer](https://mcstarters.com/blog/footer-important-for-your-website/#:~:text=Web%20pages%20are%20often%20peppered,take%20the%20actions%20they%20desire.) is the area at the bottom of each page under the main section. From a technical standpoint, landing pages don’t require footers to function correctly, but having a footer on your web page is still a great thing because it helps navigate content more efficiently by adding a well-detailed links section.
