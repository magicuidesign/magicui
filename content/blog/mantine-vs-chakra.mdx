## What Is Chakra?

![Mantine Vs Chakra](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/5uv3ckn2zua.jpg)

Chakra UI, a relatively newer player in the market than Material UI, is a React UI library emphasizing simplicity, modularity, and accessibility. It's designed to be simple to use, yet it offers a high degree of customization. Chakra UI's unique style props approach not only makes the development process highly intuitive and efficient but also opens up a world of possibilities for developers and designers.

### Why Choose Chakra Over Mantine?

Chakra UI aims to provide a robust set of accessible and reusable UI components for your React applications. It's built on styled-components and emotion for a seamless developer experience. The library is highly customizable, allowing developers to tweak components using the style prop. You can inspect and modify Chakra UI components via developer tools, ensuring it's easy to customize things whenever necessary.

Unlike Material UI, which defines its own design system, [Chakra UI](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/tech-hot-takes-chakra-ui-review-6fcce4d8dc66) is designed to be unopinionated. This means you can use Chakra UI to build your own design system or tweak it to fit your existing design system. It provides a palette of components that can be easily mixed and matched to suit your application's needs.

Key Features of Chakra

#### Effortless Onboarding

One of the standout features of Chakra UI is its comprehensive documentation, which makes it extremely easy to get up and running with the library. The documentation provides clear and concise examples of how to use each component and detailed explanations of all the available props. This makes it easy to hit the ground running with Chakra UI and build beautiful interfaces quickly.

#### Building Inclusive Interfaces

Another key feature of Chakra UI is its focus on accessibility. All components come with default styles that are accessible out of the box, so you don't have to worry about your app's accessibility if you're using Chakra UI components. The library encourages developers to follow best practices regarding accessibility, making it easier to build accessible applications.

Chakra UI also provides a theming system that allows you to customize the appearance of your app globally. You can define a theme object using your own colors, fonts, and other styles and pass it to the ChakraProvider component to apply your custom theme to all components in your app. This makes it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel across your app without manually styling each component.

#### Tailored Aesthetics

Chakra UI is a fantastic choice for developers who want a flexible, accessible, and customizable UI library for their React applications. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a great option for beginners and experienced developers. Whether you're building a simple portfolio site or a complex web application, Chakra UI is your pick.
