## What Is A SaaS Landing Page?

![Best SaaS Landing Pages](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/q8xfban5tn.jpg)

A SaaS landing page is a sales page aimed at cold-selling your product or service to your website visitors. It is used in the products and services marketing strategy where users are asked for an immediate sale without any prior purchaser contact.

### Purpose of a SaaS Landing Page

A SaaS landing page is a page on your website that an interested visitor can land on to find more information about your product. It’s designed to promote or sell your software online. It doesn't necessarily have to be related to the actual application, but it should provide information about how it works and what benefits it can provide.

### Additional Functions of a SaaS Landing Page

These pages can also be used to announce new features, promote events, generate leads, or capture emails for a mailing list. Elements are commonly found on landing pages as well, such as:

- [Demo videos](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/demo-video)
- Interface screenshots
- Chatbots

### Importance of Understanding Your Audience

Understanding your audience is the most important factor in creating a good SaaS landing page.

- What are their needs?
- What will motivate them to purchase?
- What do you want the result of the page to be?

After you've answered those questions, you can create an effective SaaS landing page that informs potential customers and encourages them to convert into leads, contacts, or even customers.

### Conversion Rates for SaaS Landing Pages

The average [conversion rate of a landing page](https://popupsmart.com/blog/what-is-a-good-landing-page-conversion-rate) is around 2.35%, so you will need all the techniques, inspiration, and best practices to ensure your landing page's conversion rate meets or exceeds the average.

## 6 Key Elements Of A High Converting SaaS Landing Page

![Best SaaS Landing Pages](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/jm0xicf3b1a.jpg)

### 1\. Hero Section

The hero section is the first thing users see when they visit a SaaS landing page. It's crucial to capture attention immediately and provide essential information to keep the visitor manageable.

### 2\. Features/Benefits

This section is where you highlight the unique selling points of your SaaS product. A detailed comparison table showing features for each subscription tier can be highly effective for potential customers to understand the value they get for the price.

### 3\. Social Proof

Adding social proof to your landing page can significantly boost conversions. Build trust with potential customers who are considering a free trial with the help of:

- Testimonials
- Customer logos
- Star ratings
- Case studies

### 4\. Contact Form

Including a contact form on your landing page can help capture leads who have unanswered questions. Placing the form lower on the page can encourage users still on the fence to reach out for more information.

### 5\. Demo Video

Providing a product demo video can be an effective way to showcase your SaaS product's capabilities. This can help users better understand how your product can solve their pain points and lead to higher conversion rates.

### 6\. Call-To-Action (CTA)

While [multiple CTAs](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/how-many-ctas-are-too-many) can create distractions and reduce conversions, using FOMO elements like a countdown timer can encourage users to click the CTA button. Keep your CTA clear and compelling to drive users to take action and sign up for a free trial.

- The landing page is very minimalistic, with only a few images and CTA buttons. It’s free from excess dropdown menus or unnecessary buttons.

- These creative liberties make the full landing page feel friendlier, inspiring, and more likely to evoke positive emotions in site visitors.

- The CTA button uses blue (a cool color) to contrast against the warm yellow color in the video thumbnail.

### 17\. Loom

To reflect Loom’s brand identity as a screen recording software, its landing page heavily focuses on multimedia elements — particularly videos.

### 19\. Figma

Figma’s enterprise software landing page is an excellent example of personalization.

- To keep the full landing page consistent with Figma’s brand palette and visual style, it features many sharp and vibrant elements against a white background.

Enterprise SaaS marketing is all about overcoming the longer sales cycle since these types of users don’t make purchase decisions on a whim. As such, Figma includes various resources, including an economic report and customer success stories.

### 20\. Canva

SaaS landing page design must adapt depending on which product, tool, or feature is being highlighted.

- Canva’s logo maker landing page uses simple text and a CTA button with a darker shade of violet to prompt users to start creating.
- The landing page also makes the task feel less daunting for new users by showing screenshots of the interface and telling them that they can get their logos in minutes.
- It might not be the best SaaS landing page if you’re trying to advertise a full-suite platform, but when covering a single tool, Canva hits the nail right on the head.

This landing page effectively answers all the questions those interested in a project management SaaS want to know. CTA buttons are strategically located throughout the page to move the visitor along the sales funnel.

### 23\. Dropbox

Normally, we wouldn't advise a long-scrolling landing page, but Dropbox has hit the nail on the head by combining its home page with a veritable LP. This won't work for a wide variety of websites, as there are generally too many opportunities for distraction when so much information is contained on one page. Still, it works exceptionally well here for a few reasons.

- Given that the concept behind the offering is simple, it's not hard to explain how it's helpful in just a few pages and images, and it becomes more compelling the more you read their succinct copy blocks.
- All signs point to sign-ups or sales.
- Even the CTAs that don't link to a form link to other information, which, in turn, also link to the opportunity to sign up or buy.
- Everything funnels down the same way, so little gets in the way.

### 24\. Marketo

While other landing page spreads need multiple images to showcase their power, Marketo's does not. It's important to point out that it's not that we find this LP perfect, but more so that they're aptly leveraging an important element beyond the offering itself: support.

Whether it matters if users are familiar with the Adobe family of products is still up for debate.

- Whoever visits this landing page will know they're getting a 2-in-1 package with their sign-up.
- They will get an easily digestible 4-minute intro demo and access to an entire video library.
- While it may take time and direct hands-on support from an expert, most folks want an easy way to learn a potential solution at their leisure, and not having to commit to a meeting might be what best suits their need.

### 25.  Domo

If there's one thing Domo does exceptionally well with this landing page, it's certainly a focus on the customer. Not only do they explain that their free trial incorporates the user's data from the get-go instead of a hokey, generic demo that showcases all of its -neatest- or most helpful features, but Domo even outlines precisely what you'll be able to walk away with after your 60-minute onboarding session.

The language on the page speaks directly to the visitor, using a lot of 'you' perspective and, in addition, providing what you'll be able to accomplish in a short amount of time. It's not just a great way to exemplify their proof of concept but also frame their free trial and offering. They even encourage continued exploration afterward to ensure trial users get first-hand experience figuring out how and why Domo can solve many of their current pain points.

## Do You Need A Landing Page For Your SaaS Product?

![Best SaaS Landing Pages](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/19uc82cco85.jpg)

Having a dedicated landing page for your SaaS product can significantly impact your conversion rates. Here are some benefits of having a dedicated landing page for a SaaS product:

### Greater Control Over the Conversion Process

A landing page is another website, meaning you have much greater control over the [conversion process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conversion-process). This control allows you to tailor the content, design, and user experience to optimize conversions.

### Optimized Design

With a dedicated landing page, you can set up a design template for your page, which presents visitors with all the key information in an organized manner. This optimized design can help increase engagement and guide visitors toward the desired action.

### Focused on Conversions

Landing pages allow you to create a seamless path for visitors interested in buying your product. They are designed specifically for this purpose and are focused solely on making conversions. This focus on conversions can lead to higher conversion rates than directing traffic to a general website.

## SaaS Landing Page Best Practices

![Best SaaS Landing Pages](https://cdn.magicui.design/assets/apturpxxpw5.jpg)

### Keep it Simple

A cluttered landing page can overwhelm visitors, so keeping your SaaS landing page design straightforward and easy to navigate is vital. A minimalist design approach, with a clear value proposition and concise product features, will keep potential customers engaged. Leveraging a prominent SaaS landing page builder and template can reduce the stress of creating a design from scratch.

### Use Strong Headlines

[Strong headlines](https://training.npr.org/2015/10/25/the-checklist-for-writing-good-headlines/) are essential for capturing a visitor's attention and drawing them into reading the rest of the landing page. By focusing on your product's benefits and delivering them in a concise and easily digestible manner, you'll increase the chances of conversion.

### Highlight Benefits

Rather than solely listing product features, emphasize how your solution can [address potential customers' pain points](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/uncover-business-pain) and improve their lives. Demonstrating the value of your product in solving specific problems will resonate more with prospects.

### Use High-Quality Visuals

Opt for high-quality images or videos that accurately represent your brand when showcasing your product's benefits and features. Generic stock photos can be a turn-off, so use visuals that align with your product and brand identity.

### Make it Mobile-friendly

It is crucial to ensure that your landing page is optimized for mobile viewing. Easy-to-read text and tap-friendly buttons are essential for a seamless mobile user experience.

### Reduce Friction

Eliminating barriers to conversion, like confusing navigation or complex forms, is key to driving more sign-ups or sales. Make sure visitors can easily understand your product and its value proposition and how to take the next step.

### Use A/B Testing

[A/B testing](https://www.kameleoon.com/ab-testing) is a powerful tool for optimizing your landing pages. Experiment with headlines, images, and calls to action to determine what resonates best with your audience and drives more conversions.

### Continuously Optimize

Optimizing your landing pages shouldn't stop after launch. Monitor your SaaS marketing metrics regularly and use insights to make data-driven improvements to your landing page over time.

### Use a Landing Page Builder/Template

Leveraging a landing page builder with clean, customizable templates can simplify your design process. [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/), for example, provides a collection of visually appealing and interactive components that can be easily integrated into web applications, helping you create stunning landing pages with minimal effort.
