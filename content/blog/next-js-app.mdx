## What Is Next JS

Next.js is a revolutionary React framework that is taking the web development world by storm, offering ways to build user-facing static websites and web applications. Known for its SEO-friendly attributes and supercharged performance, Next.js is a developer's dream come true. But what makes this framework so special, and why should you consider using it for your next project?

### Hybrid Static and Server Rendering for Lightning-Fast Load Times

One of Next.js's standout features is its hybrid static and server rendering capabilities. This means that you can serve static pages for lightning-fast load times while also having the option to dynamically render pages on the server when needed. The result is a snappy user experience that keeps visitors engaged without sacrificing performance.

### TypeScript Support for Strongly-Typed Development

For developers who crave the structure and safety of TypeScript, Next.js delivers with robust support for this popular programming language. With TypeScript, you can catch errors before they happen, write cleaner code, and enjoy enhanced productivity throughout development.

### Smart Bundling and Route Prefetching for Optimal Performance

Next.js takes care of the heavy lifting when bundling your app for production. With smart bundling, only the necessary code is sent to the user's browser, resulting in faster load times and improved performance. Next.js uses route prefetching to anticipate which pages a user might visit next, preloading them in the background for a seamless browsing experience.

### No Configuration Needed for Production-Ready Applications

Say goodbye to extensive configuration files and boilerplate code - Next.js provides everything you need out of the box to build production-ready applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or starting out, you can hit the ground running with Next.js and build amazing websites and web applications quickly.

## Next JS Styling And Features

![Next JS](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510915228340-29c85a43dcfe?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxjb2RlcnxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MTk5OTE3NTh8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Next.js supports:

- Styling with CSS
- Precompiled Scss and Sass
- CSS-in-JS
- Styled JSX

In addition, it is built with TypeScript support and smart bundling. The open-source transpiler SWC transforms and compiles code into JavaScript that is usable by a browser. TurboPack, another open-source tool, bundles the modules afterward. All of these tools are used with npm in a terminal.

### Server-Side Rendering

The main feature of Next.js is its use of server-side rendering to reduce the burden on web browsers and provide enhanced security. This can be done for any part of the application or the entire system, allowing content-rich pages to be singled out for server-side rendering. It can also be done only for first-time visitors to reduce the burden on web browsers that have yet to download site assets.

### Developer Experience

The hot reloading feature detects changes as they are made and re-renders the appropriate pages so the server avoids the need to be restarted. This allows changes to the application code to be immediately reflected in the web browser, though some browsers will require the page to be refreshed.

The software uses page-based routing for developer convenience and includes support for dynamic routing. Other features include hot-module replacement so that modules can be replaced live, automatic code splitting, which only includes code necessary to load the page, and page prefetching to reduce load time.

### Static Site Generation & Incremental Regeneration

Next.js also supports incremental static regeneration and static site generation—a compiled version of the website is usually built during build time and saved as a .next folder. When a user makes a request, the pre-built version, which is a static HTML page, is cached and sent to them. This makes the [load time very fast](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack), but it's unsuitable for every website, particularly for interactive sites that change often and utilize a lot of user input.

Next.js can be used to build various websites with various goals and purposes. The benefits it offers and its server-side rendering feature make it an ideal choice for certain types of web applications. Here are some of the specific cases where using Next.js is advantageous:

### 1\. Large Multi-User Websites

Next.js works well for websites with many users where server-side rendering can enhance performance and scalability.

### 2\. Client-Side Rendered Applications (SPA/MPA)

If you are building a complex web application that requires client-side rendering, Next.js can be a great choice due to its efficiency.

### 3\. E-Commerce Platforms

Next.js is suitable for building e-commerce platforms that need dynamic content and fast loading times to optimize the user experience.

## How To Create A Next JS App

Creating a [new Next.js project](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application) is easy and straight to the point. You can create a Next.js project differently, but CLI is the most preferred and recommended approach.

- To create a new Next.js application with CLE, have NPX installed (NPX has been shipped by default since npm 5.2.0), npm v6.1, or yarn.
- Type in the following command in the right folder you want to place your Next.js project:

```bash
  npx create-next-app
  // Follow the instructions to create your first Next.js project.
  cd <project-name>
  npm run dev
```

- Make sure to replace the `<project-name>` with your actual project name. You can then start creating different pages and components required by your project.
- After creating a new Next.js project from a CLI, you’ll notice a Next.js app with a lean folder tree. This default folder structure is the bare minimum to run a Next.js app. When you build your project, you’ll initially have more folders and files than the framework.

### Core Next.js Folders: `app/pages`, `public`, and `styles`

The only Next.js-specific folders are the `app/pages`, `public`, and `styles` folders. These should not be renamed unless you’re prepared to adjust additional configurations.

Below is the default folder structure for a new Next.js project:

```javascript
# other files and folders, .gitignore, package.json...
/app
├── api
│   └── hello.js
├── page.js
/public
├── favicon.ico
├── vercel.svg
/styles
├── globals.css
└── Home.module.css
```

## Drawbacks Of Using Next JS

![Next JS](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1633180888652-c561b86040f1?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHxzdGlja3klMjBub3RlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcxOTk5MTgwNXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Development and maintenance cost

The flexibility provided by Next.js can come at a high price, including development and maintenance costs. You might need a dedicated Next.js developer and frontend expert to make changes and maintain the application, which can be costly.

### Lack of built-in state manager

Next.js does not offer built-in support for state management. If you need any form of state management, you must install and use it, just like you would with React.

### Low on plugins

When using Next.js, you may find fewer easy-to-adapt plugins available than other frameworks. This could limit your options and require more custom solutions.
