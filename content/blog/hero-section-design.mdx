## 11 Best Practices for a Website Hero Section Design

![Hero Section Design](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529119651565-dc15bd8c75fd?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHxzdGlja3klMjBub3RlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMjQwNjUwMHww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Choose High-Quality Images

The hero image is the first thing visitors see, so it needs to make a great impression. Use high-resolution images that are crisp and clear. The ideal hero image captures the user’s attention and supports your value proposition.

#### Understanding Your Audience and Crafting Your Message

The most practiced designers perform exhaustive user research to understand their target audience and carefully consider how their images relate to their product or service. Your goal can be to evoke an emotion, promote a product, or enhance your brand identity.

### 2\. Choose Your Words Carefully

Highlighting what would benefit your target audience is a great way to hold your users’ attention. Remember that prospects are coming to your website because they have a problem. By putting your value proposition front and center, you can offer them a solution to that problem in just a few words. This will keep them wanting to know more.

### 3\. The Call-to-Action Button Should Be Visually Prominent

The CTA button clearly indicates which action to take. Therefore, it should be visually prominent and easy to locate, limiting distractions as best as possible. Stick to clear, easily understood verbs for the labels, such as:

- Join
- Create
- Sign up, etc.

### 4\. Don’t Overuse Call-to-Action Buttons

Ideally, you should have just one CTA button in the hero section connected to the main action you want users to take. If you have two potential actions, prioritize the more important action as the primary button and designate the other as secondary. Both buttons should have distinct visual weights to help users identify the key action.

### 5\. Use Legible Fonts

Use clear, legible fonts that complement your brand. Keep your use of font styles and weights to a minimum to avoid visual clutter.

### 6\. Be Mindful of Space

Maintain ample spacing between elements in your design. You don’t need to fill every space in the hero section. Organize information in a way that’s approachable, logical, and easy to understand to reduce your user's cognitive load.

### 7\. Mobile Friendliness

Ensure your hero section is visually appealing and functions smoothly on all devices, prioritizing mobile compatibility for a seamless user experience.

### 8\. Accessibility

Make your website easy to use for everyone by describing images with text, choosing clear fonts, and using well-contrast colors.

### 9\. Brand Alignment

The hero section should use the same:

- Colors
- Fonts
- Pictures

Using these elements helps create a consistent look that people can easily remember and recognize.

### 10\. Maintain Consistency

Keep your website looking the same throughout using the same fonts, colors, and images representing your brand. This helps build trust, makes your brand more memorable, and gives users a cohesive experience.

### 11\. Test Your Design Decisions

Testing different versions of your hero section design using A/B testing will help you:

- Determine what resonates with your audience
- Refine your design
- Create a hero section that captures and retains your users’ attention
