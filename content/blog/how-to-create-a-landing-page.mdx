Many businesses struggle with creating a landing page that resonates with their audience and converts visitors into paying customers. In this blog, we'll guide you through creating a landing page and provide valuable insights on the best practices to adopt optimized [landing page examples](https://magicui.design/blog/landing-page-examples).

## What is a Landing Page?

![How To Create A Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487611459768-bd414656ea10?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHx3ZWJzaXRlJTIwaG9tZXBhZ2V8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzIwNjQ4MTE3fDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

A landing page is designed to turn site visitors into leads or customers. Their primary function is to direct visitors to the CTA. Most landing pages feature personalized content and a clear CTA to encourage users to take the desired action, such as:

- Filling out a contact form
- Downloading content
- Purchasing

### Maximizing Conversions with Multiple Landing Pages

A website can have multiple landing pages. For example, you may create different landing pages to test out different messaging or layouts and see which version your visitors respond to the most. You can also create different landing pages to send visitors through a series of choices to land on a tailored CTA. This is known as a click funnel.

## What Are Landing Pages Good For?

![How To Create A Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1688561808434-886a6dd97b8c?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw4fHxvbiUyMGVjb21tZXJjZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjA2NDgzNTV8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

Landing pages educate your visitors and use compelling content to transform them into clients. They also serve as a representation of your website and your business. For example, in most cases, a landing page is the first thing a visitor will see after clicking on an ad. However, while it may be your audience's first page, a landing page differs from a web page's focus on conversion and lead generation.

### Landing Pages Designed for Conversions

A landing page stands alone, often at the forefront of a homepage, and serves a single purpose: getting your visitors to give you their contact information. Landing pages have limited navigation and direct visitors to a call to action. They give your offer or promotion a place to live and act as a [gate to your materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page).

### The Rise of Landing Pages

Landing pages were developed in 2003 by Microsoft's IT department in response to disappointing sales of its Office software at the time. Since then, they have become a key part of many businesses' digital marketing strategies.

### Reference vs. Transactional Landing Pages

There are two main types of landing pages:

- Reference
- Transactional

Reference pages are designed to provide targeted information about a specific product or service without any other distractions on website pages. A transactional page aims to move visitors to take action from a CTA, usually by submitting their email addresses through a form.

## Good To Know and Useful Tips About Landing Pages

![How To Create A Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1613759612065-d5971d32ca49?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHxpZGVhdGlvbnxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjA2NDgxNTJ8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### Simple Message and Promoting Desired Action

The landing page has one simple message to convey: promote the desired action and explain the benefits of performing this action. Keep it clear and concise.

### Design Focused on Objective 

The page's design should support the objective and not compete for attention. Keep it clean, simple, and synced with your brand identity.

### Make Site Visitors Click

The goal is to make visitors click, so ensure all buttons are labeled clearly and stand out. The design and text should reflect the call to action.

### Anatomy of a Landing Page

The landing page should be a single page divided into sections. It should be focused but not too long to maintain visitor attention.

### Powerful Visual Representation

Headers, subheaders, buttons, and images should effectively represent the message while maintaining a cohesive design. For inspiration, check out the [best landing page examples](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fantastic-landing-page-examples).

### Professional Landing Page Template

Use a professional landing page template for a visually appealing and structured design. You can also start with a free template and customize it to your brand's needs.

### Free Template and One Page Website Builder

Start with a free template and customize it for your brand's needs. You can also use a one-page website builder to tailor your landing page from scratch.

## How To Create a Landing Page In 8 Steps

![How To Create A Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1472289065668-ce650ac443d2?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHxkZXNpZ24lMjBwYWdlfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMDY0ODIwNXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Set Your campaign goal

Every landing page needs a goal. Are you summoning sales, conversions, or leads? For e-commerce marketers, it’s about turning browsers into buyers. For agencies, it’s about weaving pages to conjure more conversions. For SaaS folks, it’s creating pages to fuel your growth. Set a realistic and measurable goal to achieve it with your page.

### 2\. Select a Landing Page Template

After setting your goal, the next step is to select the appropriate landing page template. Choosing a pre-made template is more stress-free than starting from scratch because you can use its layout and build upon it.

#### MagicUI Pro for Powerful Landing Pages

Most landing page builders offer time-saving templates, providing a solid foundation for customization. [Magic UI](https://pro.magicui.design/docs/templates/startup) Pro enhances this by saving thousands of hours and offering customizable templates to convert visitors into customers. With animated components, your landing page becomes more engaging and effective, making it easier to achieve specific goals.

### 3\. Write Your Copy

You should know that a landing page copy is twice as important to conversion rates as the design. Landing pages are concise by design, so it’s important to nail every word.

Here are some tips on how to write your landing page to the best of your ability:

#### Nail the Headline

You have less than 15 seconds to grab a visitor’s attention on a landing page, making the headline crucial. Ensure it is memorable, clear, and solves the visitor’s main problem.

#### Focus on the Benefits

Focus on how your product solves visitors’ problems and benefits them rather than listing features. Craft irresistible copy from their perspective, and refer to our guide for effective landing page copywriting.

#### Keep It Simple

In general, landing pages convert better when they’re easy to read and not overly long. Avoid sounding like a business textbook, keep your sentences short and sweet, and cut out any unnecessary copy you don’t need on the page.

### 4\. Craft Your CTA

Your CTA is crucial on your landing page. It’s the action you want visitors to take, whether filling out a form or hitting a button. Make it [compelling and clear](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-write-an-effective-call-to-action) to convince visitors effectively. Getting your CTA can make or break your landing page’s success.

Visitors won’t know what to expect when they click a button like:

- Learn More
- Get Started

Here are effective CTAs for better results:

- See Pricing
- Start Your Free Trial
- Book A Demo

### 5\. Select Your Images 

Now that you’ve got your copy written like the wordsmith you are, it’s time to bring out that inner Picasso to work on the visuals of your landing page (but seriously, no pressure.)

Before you get thrown into full design mode, you can start out by selecting what images you want to feature:

- Product images
- Stock photos
- Custom illustrations

#### Choose a Hero Image

You want to come in hot. Most great landing pages start with a big, beautiful image to show visitors what the offer is all about.

#### Go for People Over Product

People like seeing people. Make real photographs of people using or enjoying the product on your landing page whenever possible. People-focused imagery helps visitors connect with your offer on a more personal and emotional level.

#### Visualize the Benefits

Wondering how your offer looks in action? Use images throughout your landing page to convey its benefits. Since many visitors won’t read every word, supplement your copy with different product images or custom illustrations to help tell a visual story effectively.

### 6\. Connect Your Landing Page 

A landing page all by itself won’t do you much good. Here’s how to connect to your business domain, set up analytics, and integrate any other tools in your marketing stack:

#### Set Your URL

Your URL also reflects your brand experience. Connect your landing page to your domain and customize the URL.

#### Add Tracking and Custom Scripts

After putting in all this hard work on your landing page, you’ll want to know who’s visiting it and their actions. Embed tracking for scripts like Google Analytics or any other analytics software to gather data as you go.

### 7\. Preview and Publish

This right here is the moment you’ve been waiting for. But before you pop the champagne and hit publish on your landing page, give it one more look-over to ensure you’re ready for a world debut.

#### Check the Copy

Do a quick spot-check to ensure your page is free of typos or grammar issues. You don’t want to make a bad first impression.

#### Check the SEO

Make sure you select whether or not you want your page to be visible to search engines and optimize it by writing a keyword-focused page title and meta description.

#### Check the Forms

Is everything working the way you want it to? Did you set up a “Thank You” page after someone submits? Go through the page as a visitor to see if you missed anything. Do it right now; we’re watching.

### 8\. Optimize Your Landing Page

Landing page creation is practically over at this step. Yet you don’t just publish your landing page and forget it. You need to test and optimize it to maximize its performance. The best way to do that is through A/B testing.

Some key elements that you should test include:

- Headline: Try out a different version of your headline
- Visuals: Change the hero image with a new one on your page
- CTA: Design an alternative CTA button with a twist in the copy

## Landing Page vs. Website: When Should You Use Each?

### When You Should Use a Website?

A website is the path to establishing a strong online presence and making more people aware of your brand. It should centralize all essential information, including your:

- Blog
- Careers page
- Product pages

### When You Should Use a Landing Page?

A landing page should be your go-to if you have a specific marketing goal, like:

- Increasing leads
- Sign-ups
- Sales
- Starting a book club

A landing page is designed for one clear call to action, minimizing distractions to guide visitors directly toward your desired action. It’s an efficient way to achieve your marketing objectives directly and effectively.

## 4 Best Practices for Creating a Landing Page

![How To Create A Landing Page](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517245386807-bb43f82c33c4?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w1MTI2OTd8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwzfHxkaXNjdXNzfGVufDB8fHx8MTcyMDY0ODE3N3ww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080)

### 1\. Specify Landing Page Goal

Creating a landing page with a single, focused goal is crucial for increasing conversions. Avoid sending mixed messages and use a consistent CTA across your ad and landing page form instead.

### 2\. Choose a Relevant Hero Image

[Selecting the right hero image](https://dowelldesignstudio.com/how-to-choose-a-hero-image/) is key when designing a landing page. Consider your target audience and choose an image that will resonate with them. The image should appeal to visitors and strengthen your message or value proposition.

### 3\. Treat Your CTA With Utmost Care

Study effective CTAs to determine which will work best for your specific purpose. Effective CTAs are benefit-focused, concise, and feature action verbs. Highlighting your CTA using contrasting colors, negative space, and strategic placement can increase its visibility and effectiveness.

### 4\. Do A/B Testing

A/B testing, or split testing, involves creating two slightly different landing page variations to determine which yields better results. When conducting A/B testing, make minor changes to one element simultaneously to isolate variables. Examples of A/B testing include comparing different CTAs, headlines, or hero images. Use the ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) framework to [prioritize variables for testing](https://blog.growthhackers.com/the-practical-advantage-of-the-ice-score-as-a-test-prioritization-framework-cdd5f0808d64).
