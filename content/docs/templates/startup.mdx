### Who is this for?

You are an indiehacker, bootstrapper, YC startup, solopreneur, VC-backed startup, developer, or student.

You are thinking about launching a new idea or already have a prototype. Maybe it's an AI SaaS, a crazy drone robot company, or just a simple digital product. 

But... you dread the idea of learning react or anything frontend 😩

**This template is exactly what you're looking for.**

### Why should I use this?

- ✅ 1-click download and setup. 
- ✅ 5 minutes to update the text and images.
