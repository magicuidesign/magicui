## Introduction

I love MAgic Ui. While working with MagicUI, I identified an opportunity to enhance the component library's flexibility by implementing inline style support. This addition enables more dynamic styling capabilities across all components.

## Why This Matters

The addition of the `style` prop provides several key benefits:
- Enables runtime style modifications
- Supports dynamic value injection
- Allows for more complex styling patterns that aren't achievable through className alone

## Implementation Example

Here's a practical example demonstrating the value of this enhancement:

```jsx
<BlurFade className="h-[200px] w-[32%]" delay={1.618} inView
    style={{
        backgroundColor: JK_Colors?.purple,
        boxShadow: `6.18px 6.18px 0px ${JK_Colors?.purple_accent}`
    }}>
    <Link href={'/dashboard/applications'} className="h-[200px] w-[32%] rounded-lg">
    </Link>
</BlurFade>

In this example, we're using dynamic color values ( JK_Colors?.purple and JK_Colors?.purple_accent ) that 
may change during runtime. While Tailwind CSS excels at static styling, it cannot handle dynamic values that 
might be undefined or change after the initial render. The style prop provides a solution by allowing these 
values to update reactively.

## Technical Implementation
The style prop has been added to the following component interfaces (3 total):

- ImageProps in blur-image.tsx
- BlurFadeProps in blur-fade.tsx
- GradientBlurProps in gradient-blur.tsx
- CopyWithClassNamesProps in copy-button.tsx

## Update - February 1, 2025 - 6:00 PM EST

Enhanced component styling capabilities by implementing MORE style prop support across multiple components:

- Added style prop implementation to:
  - BlurFade
  - Copy-button
  - MDX-components
  - Flip-Text
  - Shine-Border
  - Word-Rotate

Theses implementation properly forwards style props to underlying elements, ensuring consistent and reliable application of dynamic styles. This enhancement maintains full TypeScript type safety through proper interface inheritance.

Note: Components already implementing React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> or similar interfaces inherently support style props and were left unchanged to maintain existing functionality.

These changes improve component flexibility while preserving the library's type-safe architecture.
These enhancements ensure consistent style handling across all major components while maintaining type safety.
