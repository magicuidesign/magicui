Magic UI started because of an annoying problem I faced in the summer of 2023.

I built my [first SaaS app](https://automatic.chat) a few months earlier and was trying to redesign the landing page for it. However, none of the code I wrote matched my expectations in my head for how it would turn out. I was irritated by the process and I especially didn't like having to deal with responsiveness, and animations in particular. Both were really time consuming for me and I felt like I wasn't making progress on actually delivering value to my SaaS users.

I was trying to make landing pages like https://linear.app, https://wope.com and https://reflect.app but they were instead turning out like websites designed in 1995.

**I tried to search the web for good tutorials, code examples, or guides on how to make a landing page like https://linear.app but I found nothing.**

That same week I tweeted that I would just build it myself.

This tweet immediately went viral and it seemed like there were others like me who resonated!

I started building the foundations of this site as well as a few components and within 10 days, Magic UI was in the hands of users.

People seem to love it and we're just getting started.
