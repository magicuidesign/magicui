Magic UI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your web apps.

It primarily features components, blocks, and templates geared towards creating landing pages and user-facing marketing materials.

__I personally believe that good design contributes significant value to software. It's one of the main methods of establishing trust between you and an internet stranger__. Trust is important for internet businesses because it is the first thing a visitor evaluates before pulling out their credit card and becoming a customer.

Some questions visitors might ask themselves are:
- "Is this company legit?"
- "Who else is using it?"
- "Can I trust them with my personal data?"

__Poor design reflects poorly on your team.__ It comes off as lazy, unfinished, and unstable. It shows that the team doesn't care about user experience. 

__Good design tells me that the team behind has their shit together.__ I can probably expect good things from them in the future. 

It makes users think "if they care so much about these tiny details, they must care a lot about other things in the company, including their customers!". 

A great example of this in play is https://linear.app landing page which I first came across in 2020. I didn't even need to try the product but I already knew that it *must* be good.
