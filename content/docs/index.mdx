description: Create magical landing pages with components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

Magic UI is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. 

It primarily features components, blocks, and templates geared towards creating landing pages and user-facing marketing materials.

__I personally believe that good design contributes significant value to software. It's one of the main methods of establishing trust between you and an internet stranger__. Trust is important for internet businesses because it is the first thing a visitor evaluates before pulling out their credit card and becoming a customer.

Some questions visitors might ask themselves are:
- "Is this company legit?"
- "Who else is using it?"
- "Can I trust them with my data?"

Poor design reflects poorly on your product and it comes off as lazy, unfinished, and unstable. Good design immediately tells me that an app, and the team behind it has their shit together and that I can expect good things from them in the future. 

When I personally come across a product with pleasant microinteractions, and an emphasis on tiny details, I somehow immediately trust them more. It makes me think "if they care so much about these tiny things, they must care a lot about everything else in the company, including their customers!". 

A great example of this in play is https://linear.app landing page which I first came across in 2020.


## Story

Magic UI started because of an annoying problem I faced in the summer of 2023. 

I developed my [first SaaS app](https://automatic.chat) a few months earlier and was trying to redesign the landing page for it. However, none of the code I wrote matched my expectations in my head for how it would turn out. I was irritated by the process and I especially didn't like having to deal with responsiveness, and animations in particular. Both were really time consuming for me and I felt like I wasn't making progress on actually delivering value to my SaaS users.

I was trying to make landing pages like https://linear.app, https://wope.com and https://reflect.app but they were instead turning out like websites designed in 1995.

**I tried to search the web for good tutorials, code examples, or guides on how to make a landing page like https://linear.app but I found nothing.**

That same week I tweeted that I would just build it myself.

This tweet immediately went viral and it seemed like there were others like me who resonated!

I started building the foundations of this site as well as a few components and within 10 days, Magic UI was in the hands of users.
