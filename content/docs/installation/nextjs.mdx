<Steps>

### Information

This project and all components are written in **TypeScript**. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.

### Create project

Start by creating a new Next.js project using create-next-app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### Configure your project

You will be asked a few questions to configure your project:

```txt showLineNumbers
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `magicui-cli` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx magicui-cli init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? » Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? » Slate
Would you like to use CSS variables for colors? ... no / yes
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx magicui-cli add blur-in
```

The command above will add the `Blur In` animation component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import BlurIn from "@/components/magicui/blur-in";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <BlurIn word={"Hello World"}></BlurIn>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
