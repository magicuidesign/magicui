<Steps>

### Prerequisites

These are the main dependencies you will need to get started.

```bash
npx @svelte-add/tailwindcss@latest # add tailwindcss
npm install tailwind-variants clsx tailwind-merge svelte-inview
```

Copy and paste the following code into your project.

```typescript
// lib/utils.ts
import clsx, { ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

### Install components

That's it! Now you can go to any [component](/components) page and follow the instructions there

You only need to copy + paste the components you need! No bloat or third-party dependencies.
